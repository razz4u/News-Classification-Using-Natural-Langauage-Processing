Reuters - China is focused on solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through talk and peaceful mean Chinese President Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday The United States and South Korea have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanction on North Korea after it nuclear test on Sunday that Pyongyang said wa an advanced hydrogen bomb Washington and it ally have said there is a growing urgency for China North Korea s top ally and trading partner to apply more pressure on it already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on it nuclear weapon and missile program China s focus on negotiation contrast with Trump s assertion over the last few day that now wa not the time to focus on talk with North Korea In a telephone call with UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday President Trump reiterated that now is not the time to talk to North Korea and made clear that all option remain open to defend the United States and it ally against North Korean aggression the White House said on Wednesday However the issue wa not mentioned in a separate White House statement on the Trump-Xi call which said only that the two leader recognized the danger posed by North Korea and committed to working together with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula Earlier a statement from China s foreign ministry said China unswervingly work to realize denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard the international nuclear non-proliferation system Xi told Trump At the same time we always persist in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation Xi said It is necessary to stay on the path of a peaceful solution Xi also said that China attache importance to Trump s visit to China later this year The statement cited Trump a saying that the United States wa deeply concerned about the Korean nuclear issue and that it valued China s important role in resolving the problem US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday of begging for war and urged the Security Council to impose the strongest possible sanction Beijing ha said reining in North Korea is not chiefly it responsibility and ha expressed doubt that UN economic sanction which it ha backed will resolve the situation Sanctions so far appear to have done little to stop North Korea from boosting it nuclear and missile capacity a it face off with Trump who ha vowed to stop Pyongyang from being able to hit the US mainland with a nuclear weapon It is unclear if China will back further sanction Beijing fear that completely cutting off North Korea could lead to it collapse unleashing a wave of refugee into China s northeast China accounted for 92 percent of North Korea s trade in 2016 according to South Korea China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it would take part in Security Council discussion in a responsible and constructive manner China and Russia have advocated a plan in which the United States and Seoul stop major military drill in exchange for North Korea halting it weapon program but neither side is willing to budge Trump and Xi last spoke by telephone on Aug 12 The White House said at the time that their relationship wa extremely close and will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem But tension in China-US tie have increased since Trump took office with the US president having authorized an investigation into China s alleged theft of intellectual property and suggesting trade relation would be linked to Beijing s help on North Korea',\n 'During President Obama s final National Security speech a president he took a moment to let

be taken for granted Each of u ha a responsibility to sustain it The universal right to speak your mind protest against authority To live in a society that s open and free That can criticize a president without retribution If Trump actually want to be president he s going to have to learn how to handle criticism and he s going to have to learn fast He s not only going to get criticized by both side of the aisle but by the public at large and the rest of the world He need to be able to handle that and not do anything to threaten our national security nor the freedom of American citizen

federal regulation on Wednesday helped by at least one Democrat a the US Senate began work on legislation to change nearly every step agency take in creating and applying new rule Republicans have said they deem lightening federal regulation which they consider costly and burdensome a much a priority a overhauling healthcare and rewriting the tax code For most of President Donald Trump ’ s first 100 day the Republican-led Congress attacked regulation by passing resolution to wipe some of former Democratic President Barack Obama ’ s rule off the book under the Congressional Review Act Trump also ordered agency to scrap two existing rule every time they enact a new one Just before Trump ’ s January inauguration the House of Representatives passed the “ Regulatory Accountability Act ” combining a half dozen bill to radically change government regulation On Wednesday Senator Rob Portman a Ohio Republican and Senator Heidi Heitkamp a North Dakota Democrat introduced a version of the act for that chamber If it pass the bill will be combined with the House version for Trump to sign into law The bill would bring “ our outdated federal regulatory process into the 21st Century by requiring agency to use the best scientific and economic data available strengthening check and balance and giving the public a voice in the process ” Portman said in a statement It requires stricter cost-benefit analysis use of the “ best available science ” to craft rule and review of regulation according to a summary The bill diverges from the House version on what is known a the “ Chevron Deference ” based on a Supreme Court ruling that court should defer to agency ’ interpretation of statute governing their rulemaking The House legislation eliminates the Chevron Deference while the Senate one creates a judicial review process where court can decide if agency comply with the law and then remand non-compliant rule to agency Courts would also review factual determination used in drafting rule costing more than $ 1 billion annually Environmental and labor group said the Senate bill could block needed new regulation and weaken existing one “ This bill would tilt the scale in favor of polluter at the public ’ s expense ” said Scott Slesinger legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council “ It would make it virtually impossible to safeguard the public from dirty air unsafe drinking water and other health threat ”',\n 'PARIS Reuters - Hundreds of pro-Palestinian activist on Saturday staged a protest in Paris against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

black church in Detroit this weekend but his campaign seems to be very uneasy about it Why else would they script answer to the pre-selected question that Bishop Wayne Jackson will ask him ? Seriously That s what they did The New York Times obtained a copy and it sound nothing like TrumpIt s not uncommon for campaign to submit pre-written question that they want a specific interviewer to ask It is unusual though for a campaign to take this step to say nothing of involving their party s national committee in the scripting process Trump lauded by the crazy on the right and his campaign staff a merely freewheeling and unscripted reverts into racism sexism and childish personal attack without script Of course that ha the GOP terrifiedThe first question that Bishop Jackson will ask according to The Times is Are you a Christian and do you believe the Bible is an inspired word of God ? Trump ha always had trouble with question like that seeing a how he s really not very Christian He can t name his favorite Bible verse and ha fallen flat on his backside when asked about his faith and the Bible His scriptwriter hope to gloss over all of that with the following answer if indeed it can be called that As I went through my life thing got busy with business but my family kept me grounded to the truth and the word of God His family ? Which of his three wife doe that answer refer to ? It s like they re trying to make evangelicals forget that he think wife are disposableAnywayThey also want him to say I treasure my relationship with my family and through them I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God Har de har harAnother question is What he would say to undecided black voter ? This answer is more Trumpian and le Christian than the previous because it end with a silly lie of a boast If you want a strong partner in this journey you will vote for me I will never let you down By the way my support is now up to 8 percent and climbing Let s be clear Trump s favorability rating with the black community had reached the lofty dreg of zero le than a week ago But this is the GOP When the truth or even distorted version of the truth don t work lie Then get all righteously indignant when someone ha the gall to point that lie outThey want him to give this half-answer when asked what his vision is for the black community If we are to make America great again we must reduce rather than highlight issue of race in this country and I want to make race disappear a a factor in government and governance ' And they want him to avoid the word racism altogether even though he s likely to be asked outright whether he s racistInterestingly enough that script isn t the only thing the campaign is doing to keep Trump from tripping over his own tarnished-silver tongue here The interview will air on Bishop Jackson s television network a week after it take place so the campaign ha time to edit itYes they want to be able to edit it When Trump is reading prepared remark he either sound lifeless and bored or he go off-script anyway So they re prepping for that very strong possibility They need this interview to reflect what the campaign want and not what Trump really thinksIn short this is the GOP trying to spin Trump s racism into something grand and good It s also nothing but a show it s not a real attempt at outreach and really why should it be ?

the US government and mainstream medium s Russian Hacking meme a hoax It turn out we were right More than mere canard however these type of medium disinformation talking point are how the establishment manufacture public consent for corrupt and dysfunctional policy Once these fabricated talking point are circulated through the medium they later make their way into the mouth of politician who repeat them incessantly and in the case of the Senate and Congressional committee hearing on Russia and cabinet confirmation hearing use the fake canard to bully people who are testifying on Capitol Hill The fake 17 intelligence agency claim wa used by nearly everyone who used the hearing to grandstand and act tough on Russia including pro-war Senators John McCain Marco Rubio Adam Schiff and countless others It wa also employed by Hillary Clinton along with ever single panel expert on CNN and MSNBC who used the lie to prop-up their contrived and politicized narrative about how Russia hacked and influenced the 2016 electionWhat s more crucial though is to realize the absolute key role to New York Times play in this process of giving fake news the venire of officialdom at a government and mainstream level They are a pivotal distribution point in the western propaganda dissemination machine a nearly every US broadcast network across 4 time zone will routinely reference the New York Times a their primary source 21WIRE ha chronicled their exploit in helping to promote a series of illegal US-waged war around the worldConsortium News Exclusive A founding Russia-gate myth is that all 17 US intelligence agency agreed that Russia hacked into and distributed Democratic email a falsehood that The New York Times ha belatedly retracted report Robert Parry Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe New York Times ha finally admitted that one of the favorite Russia-gate canard that all 17 US intelligence agency concurred on the assessment of Russian hacking of Democratic email is falseOn Thursday the Times appended a correction to a June 25 article that had repeated the false claim which ha been used by Democrats and the mainstream medium for month to brush aside any doubt about the foundation of the Russia-gate scandal and portray President Trump a delusional for doubting what all 17 intelligence agency supposedly knew to be trueIn the Times White House Memo of June 25 correspondent Maggie Haberman mocked Trump for still refusing to acknowledge a basic fact agreed upon by 17 American intelligence agency that he now oversees Russia orchestrated the attack and did it to help get him elected However on Thursday the Times while leaving most of Haberman s ridicule of Trump in place noted in a correction that the relevant intelligence assessment wa made by four intelligence agency the Office of the Director of National Intelligence the Central Intelligence Agency the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency The assessment wa not approved by all 17 organization in the American intelligence community The Times grudging correction wa vindication for some Russia-gate skeptic who had questioned the claim of a full-scale intelligence assessment which would usually take the form of a National Intelligence Estimate or NIE a product that seek out the view of the entire Intelligence Community and includes dissentsThe reality of a more narrowly based Russia-gate assessment wa admitted in May by President Obama s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Obama s CIA Director John Brennan in sworn congressional testimonyClapper testified before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on May 8 that the Russia-hacking claim came from a special intelligence community assessment or ICA produced by selected analyst from the CIA NSA and FBI a coordinated product from three agency CIA NSA and the FBI not all 17 component of the intelligence community the former DNI saidClapper further acknowledged that the analyst who produced the Jan 6 assessment on alleged Russian hacking were hand-picked from the CIA FBI and NSAYet a any intelligence expert will tell you if you hand-pick the analyst you are really hand-picking the conclusion For instance if the analyst were known to be hard-liners on Russia or supporter of Hillary Clinton they could be expected to deliver the one-sided reportthat they didPoliticized IntelligenceIn the history of US intelligence we have seen how this selective approach ha worked such a the phony determination of the Reagan administration pinning the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II and other act of terror on the Soviet UnionCIA Director William Casey and Deputy Director Robert Gates shepherded the desired finding through the process by putting the assessment under the control of pliable analyst and sidelining those who objected to this politicization of intelligenceThe point of enlisting the broader intelligence community and incorporating dissent into a final report is to guard against such stove-piping of intelligence that delivers the politically desired result but ultimately distorts realityAnother painful example of politicized intelligence wa President George W Bush s 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq s WMD that removed State Department and other dissent from the declassified version that wa given to the publicSince Clapper s and Brennan s testimony in May the Times and other mainstream news outlet have avoided a direct contradiction of their earlier acceptance of the 17-intelligence-agencies canard by simply referring to a judgment by the intelligence community That finessing of their earlier error ha allowed Hillary Clinton and other senior Democrats to continue referencing this fictional consensus without challenge at least in the mainstream mediaFor instance on May 31 at a technology conference in California Clinton referred to the Jan 6 report asserting that Seventeen agency all in agreement which I know from my experience a a Senator and Secretary of State is hard to get They concluded with high confidence that the Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voter in the election The failure of the major news organization to clarify this point about the 17 agency may have contributed to Haberman s mistake on June 25 a she simply repeated the groupthink that nearly all the Important People in Washington just knew to be trueBut the Times belated correction also underscore the growing sense that the US mainstream medium ha joined in a political vendetta against Trump and ha cast aside professional standard to the point of repeating false claim designed to denigrate himThat in turn play into Trump s Twitter complaint that he and his administration are the target of a witch hunt led by the fake news medium a grievance that appears to be energizing his supporter and could discredit whatever ongoing investigation

information is if a current FBI agent is passing information to him personally or through someone else No I ve spoken to no current FBI agent Giuliani claimed when asked by Blitzer Gosh in the last eight month nine month ten month certainly not about this Then Giuliani claimed that everything he ha been hearing is just hearsay But that apparently ha not stopped him from spewing the hearsay on Fox News and elsewhere in an effort to smear Hillary Clinton So I ve had lot of conversation with them and they have told me a lot about the I guess the disagreement between the Justice Department on the one hand and the FBI on the other But it all come from former FBI agent and it s all hearsay But that s hard to believe since Giuliani claimed that he knew about Comey s letter two day in advance and that letter wa actually released It wa not hearsayBlitzer then hit Giuliani with a statement written by Democratic congressman accusing him of obtaining leaked information from FBI agentsThe statement read This morning Rudy Giuliani one of Donald Trump s closest and most vocal campaign adviser appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the FBI s review of Clinton-related e-mail several day before FBI Director James Comey sent his letter to Congress last Friday about this letter In fact Mr Giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating Did I hear about it ? You re darn right I heard about it Again the only way Giuliani could have heard about this is if a current FBI agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else Either way the FBI ha a serious breach that is being used to help Donald Trump That s not correct Giuliani responded I ve had no conversation with anyone inside the FBI I have heard for the last four month a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the FBI the fact that FBI agent were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the Justice Department But none of it came from any current I haven t talked to a current FBI agent So Giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agent who are getting the information from current agentsBlitzer actually got Giuliani to claim that he didn t know that Comey wa going to release the information he did and that it came a a surprise but Giuliani did an about-face only second later and said it wasn t a surprise Seriously Blitzer did a great job of getting Giuliani to tie himself in knotsThe former NYC mayor then repeated his alleged hearsay once again by claiming that he ha heard from his source that FBI agent are angry at the Justice Department for not indicting Hillary Clinton despite the fact that Director Comey recommended that charge were not warrantedGiuliani then claimed that he read article about it somewhere but didn t specify where the article came from and said he s not sure if they are trueSo Giuliani claim that he is talking to former FBI agent and that what he ha heard is merely hearsay that he spread anyway a if it s the truth and then he claim that he read this information in article even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth and he still repeat it to anyone within earshotAnd Wolf Blitzer drove a stake through the heart of Giuliani s bullshit by asking one question But let me ask you a question Mayor If you don t know it s true why are you suggesting it ? Why are you going on national television talking about these issue if you don t know it s true ? Giuliani once again touted his FBI source only to then be informed by Blitzer that FBI agent sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigation and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like GiulianiHere s the video via YouTubead3media campaign= 1302 The FBI should be thoroughly investigated by the Justice Department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election This is a major breach within the FBI and it definitely look like the FBI is working with Republicans to persecute Hillary Clinton People need to be fired for this and the first person to lose their job should be Director ComeyFeatured image via screen capture from embedded video',\n 'Which brings me to President Obama While I m not calling him a genius I do think he s extremely intelligent I also believe that his tendency to use big picture thinking while drafting policy is something most Republican voter simply can t understand Take Obamacare for instance It s not a fix health care today law In fact the law itself is made to grow and evolve over time My belief is that it s a springboard to true socialized medicine But a it is now it s a long-term outlook on our health care While many Republicans want to look at the now aspect of the Affordable Care Act they seem unable to grasp the reality that a more Americans get health insurance giving them access to preventable care this lower expense down the road for everyone If people can prevent very costly heart attack stroke or other debilitating health issue now that s an overall saving for practically everyone from consumer to health insurer to doctor who now have more patient Quite literally improving the overall health of Americans will improve the health of this country It even make sense for our economy If worker are healthier because they have access to quality health care that mean there will be fewer people calling in sick to work showing up sick to work putting other employee at risk or relying on government program because their health condition that were preventable render them unable to work at all But to see all of that requires big picture thinking and Republicans seem unable to understand anything beyond the spoon-fed bumper sticker talking point they re given by the GOP and the conservative mediaGIMME A BREAK ! ! ! !

supporter were really a bad a the medium make them out to beHigh school junior James Patterson explained his reasoning I just wanted to make sure I wasn t critiquing out of ignorance I saw what he said on TV but I also know how the medium work so I wanted to see it for myself As part of his volunteer work Patterson spent his time making phone call for Trump s campaign in an office of about 20 people It didn t take him long to see the obvious he wa the only black person Through his interaction with Trump s other supporter and volunteer over the course of the day their overall attitude toward minority became clear their racism is quiet but it s still very much there Patterson said Nobody used any racial slur Nobody called me the n-word Nobody called me coon or anything but it s for lack of a better word it s micro-aggressions You know the way they look at you The way they talk about foreign policy and how they talk about oppressed group when they don t think you re listening

not acceptable But they still hold these Patterson belief that supporting Trump is their way to show that Patterson also said that he found his fellow staffer and volunteer unnerving because while they were very friendly he couldn t ignore the fact that they support Trump s disgusting rhetoric You can watch the young volunteer talk about his experience belowOverall his stint a a Trump volunteer

George Ciccariello-Maher who is currently in exile from Drexel s campus and is only teaching online class argued in a Democracy Now ! interview Monday that whiteness and white entitlement is the motivating factor behind mass-shootingsAlthough he noted that mental illness is a factor Ciccariello-Maher argued that we can t lose sight of these broader question asking what is happening with regard to not only white people but white men in particular ? Ciccariello-Maher argued that there is an institutional apparatus that train white men in violence and that encourages them to feel a though they re on the losing side of history adding that many white male feel like victim of societyWhen white men feel like victim he contended they lash out You know Trump make hay out of the fact that white men in particular feel a though they re the victim of this society despite being in absolute control of it he said at the end of a lengthy statement regarding the Texas church shooting And this is something that is powerfully dangerous and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attack more generally and the rise of far-right movement but we re certainly seeing you know clearly sort of some very serious incident of mass violence a well TRANSCRIPT FROM INTERVIEWAMY GOODMAN But I wanted to bring George Ciccariello-Maher into this conversation of Drexel University You have been you wrote immediately after the Las Vegas massacre where the 64-year-old white man named Paddock had opened fire on concertgoers below killing 59 of them After you wrote you were banned from the Drexel campus after questioning why mass shooting in the United States are almost always carried out by white men ? Is that right ? GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER Yes And to be clear when I began to write about what had happened in Las Vegas I wa really writing about this broad question right ? And I think this is a question that we all need to grapple with When you see these case of sort of mass this shocking mass brutality what is it that make white men so prone to this kind of behavior ? And what might be going on today in our country in which people are stoking a sort of victim complex among white men ? You know what might be happening today to encourage this kind of behavior and to radicalize these kind of action ? And I wa immediately subject to a torrent of sort of abuse and threat from you know right-wing medium outlet And you know we re talking about Breitbart The Daily Caller and these kind of website And it wa on the basis of those and the purported threat that they represented that I wa excluded from campus My class were initially canceled despite the fact that in my class we had had conversation about this despite the fact that my student are very knowledgeable and intuitively grasp what is going on in the world around them and were open to having conversation about these difficult thingsAMY GOODMAN So your response to what happened on Sunday ? GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER I mean I think we re seeing these kind of atrocity occurring and we need to be really asking not only What can we do ? I think these are important question what kind of immediate institutional reform whether it s targeted you know targeted gun control for domestic violence might be effective but we also can t lose sight of these broader question and ask What is going on in our society today ? What is happening with regard to not only white people but white men in particular ? What is going on with regard to race and gender a they function together ? And in this case in particular again we don t know all the fact We don t know all the detail But we re talking about institution that also serve a breeding ground for violent behavior We re talking about not only sexual assault in the military but domestic abuse of those surrounding it and those outside of it And we re talking about other institution a well that you could bring into the picture institution like policing in which domestic violence is absolutely rife and in which it s very difficult to keep weapon out of the hand of those domestic abusersAnd so we need to think very deeply I think about the structural role of what s going in the society Trump is abroad selling weapon And we ve got someone who in this case apparently wa trained you know trained to engage in violence abroad And yet we act surprised when these people have break when they fall into some kind of crisis when they find maybe feeling of entitlement frustrated that they then resort to violence when we re talking about a structure and institutional apparatus that train people in violence and that encourages them to feel a though they re on the losing side of history You know Trump make hay out of the fact that white men in particular feel a though they re the victim of this society despite being in absolute control of it And this is something that is powerfully dangerous and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attack more generally and the rise of far-right movement but we re certainly seeing you know clearly sort of some very serious incident of mass violence a wellAMY GOODMAN You know what s interesting yesterday for hour after hour after this horror on television you know it came out that there wa this mass killing in Texas and they said the worst church massacre in US history and they said the worst Texas massacre no one wa saying anything about the killer hour after hour But clearly people had seen him right ? Some had survived people outside the police He wa dead whether it wa self-inflicted or someone shot him They clearly knew And they were talking about one the tragedy and two not saying anything And it only led u to believe it must be a white man who did this because we would have known I think right away if the person wa a person of color or certainly Muslim We know that often before when it s a case where someone is a Muslim or person of color that s what they say immediately Now it wa just left hanging and so you knew that this would be the caseGEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER That s absolutely the case I think You know whiteness is never seen a a cause in and of itself of these kind of massacre of other form of violence despite the fact that whiteness is a structure of privilege and it s a structure of power and a structure that when it feel threatened you know lash out And so that s the kind of thing that we really need to think about not only why is it and I think there s a lot of attention to the fact that we demonize often Muslims or you know other people of color when these attack occur The far right of course jump on any violence by people of color and yet you know doesn t want to talk about the real deep structure of white supremacy in our society and again not just the fringe not just the Nazi movement but what people are going through every day and what it is that is driving people to these kind of situation where they feel so entitled to dominance that when that s questioned they can explode in these very very unpredictable way AMY GOODMAN And then GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER and on target that you know are not you know it s not a question of white supremacy playing a role simply because someone is targeting people of color We re talking about people who are having you know mental clear mental issue But again the cause need to be identified outside and beyond that and we need to think much much harder about what s going on in our society that make it so sickAMY GOODMAN And very clearly to clarify so what is your status now at Drexel ?

anti-tank missile the United States bought from a European country and supplied to a Syrian opposition group All of the item were made in EU state and in most case the United States broke contractual clause prohibiting retransfers by giving the weapon to armed group in Syria Evidence collected by CAR indicates that the United States ha repeatedly diverted EU-manufactured weapon and ammunition to opposition force in the Syrian conflict IS force rapidly gained custody of significant quantity of this materiel CAR said it similarly traced numerous item used by Islamic State back to export from Bulgaria to Saudi Arabia and that these were also subject to non-retransfer clause that should have barred them from being supplied to Syrian warring party Around 90 percent of weapon and ammunition

across state line from Colorado They seem to think that this is some kind of issue that is going to destroy their state with rampant crime Oklahoma and Nebraska got so worked up over it that they tried to force the SCOTUS to shut down Colorado s legal weed industryThe Republican argument is that it s causing crime to come across state border As a result they petitioned the SCOTUS to force Colorado to shut down their legalized weed industry citing that marijuana is still illegal under federal lawTo call this court case a layer cake of profound Republican hypocrisy would be understating it Let s run down a couple important pointsRepublicans are arguing that the supremacy clause of the Constitution mean that federal law completely overrules state law in regard to marijuana legalization These are the same Republicans who HATE the federal government and insist that federal law on thing like gun should simply be ignored or nullified a the confederate like to say They insist that state s right are a thing even in the face of their beloved supremacy clauseRepublicans are A-Okay with thing like gun flowing from state with weak gun law into state with higher gun regulation They do not care about the crime terror violence and death these cause because the NRA told them they are not allowed to care That joint you brought home in your pocket though is an outright declaration of war by Colorado apparentlyThe SCOTUS rejected the case saying that the state did not try to pursue the avenue available to them in lower court first The Department Of Justice said Entertaining the type of dispute at issue here essentially that one state s law make it more likely that third party will violate federal and state law in another state would represent a substantial and unwarranted expansion of this court s original jurisdiction The likelihood of this case meeting any success on behalf of red state is low at best The precedent set by some state being allowed to sue to rewrite the law in other state would be a disaster for the court not to mention for Republicans corporate overlord The NRA would be in a gasping panic over a state like Illinois or

stature a junior partner in the often awkward coalition dominated by Merkel - would probably insist on her departure according to party insider The SPD is in a much stronger negotiating position now said Tyson Barker at the Aspen Institute But I just don t see the incentive there for the SPD The grand coalition is just teetering on a majority If coalition talk fail the only way to trigger a new election under the German constitution would be for Steinmeier to suggest a parliamentary vote on Merkel a chancellor If Merkel win a majority in such a vote he would name her a chancellor If she doesn t raise a majority parliament can vote again within 14 day If she again miss the majority parliament vote again and the candidate with the most vote win Then Steinmeier could name Merkel - or whoever win the most vote - a chancellor but is not required to do so If he refrain he would dissolve parliament and new election must be held within 60 day If she is elected a chancellor Merkel could

agree with much or all of what Trump said can expect to be replaced In fact the only nation who have a favorable view of Trump are Russia and IsraelAccording to FiveThirtyEightcom Since Trump took office confidence in the president ha gone down further on average than favorability toward the US Confidence dropped 47 point US favorability just 13 point Some of the biggest decline have been in country with whom the US ha a collective defense agreement such a NATO member and Japan especially when it come to confidence in the president Mexico unsurprisingly also saw a big public opinion drop

President Obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of 63 to 73 percent Trump only ha a rating of 27 percentOne of the largest drop came from South Korea in which only 17 percent have confidence in

Knoller markknoller July 13 2016\",\n \"Reuters - When the US Supreme Court on Monday take up a challenge brought by Texas and other state to President Barack Obama ’ s executive action on immigration the eight justice face a series of legal question beginning with whether Texas and the other state challenger even have ground to bring the case Obama ’ s November 2014 order affect immigrant in the country illegally whose child are US citizen or lawful permanent resident or who themselves have been in the United States since they were child Here is a look at some of the key legal question in the case LEGAL STANDING To bring a case challenger must first demonstrate that they have legal “ standing ” arising from some injury or negative consequence In this case that mean the state need to show that they would be hurt by the Obama administration ’ s deferral of deportation for immigrant parent and child with deep tie to the United States but who are in the country illegally The state of Texas ha taken the lead in the lawsuit against the Obama administration to block the president ’ s action Texas asserts that it ha standing largely because of the expected financial cost to the state of processing temporary driver ’ s license for illegal immigrant with new authorization to live in the United States Texas subsidizes the cost of processing driver ’ s license and contends Obama ’ s action would cost it million of dollar The Obama administration reject that basis for standing to file suit asserting that any such cost are “ incidental ” and could be avoided by the state Obama administration lawyer say Texas could eliminate the subsidy for these driver ’ s license and eliminate the harm claimed by the state If a majority of the justice find that Texas lacked a sufficient injury to sue the case of United States v Texas end there and the Obama administration win RULE-MAKING REQUIREMENTS If the justice agree that Texas ha standing to bring the case they then would consider whether deferred-deportation policy that were part of Obama ’ s action violated rule-making requirement in a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act Under that law federal agency typically must issue a general notice of a proposed rule and give interested party a chance to comment Obama administration lawyer say the deferred deportation practice are not binding rule subject to the Administrative Procedure Act Rather they characterize these policy a an outgrowth of the US Department of Homeland Security ’ s discretion in determining deportation priority The administration contends that the homeland security secretary should be able to focus his department 's limited resource on deporting serious criminal and securing the border ’ TAKE CARE ’ A final possible question for the justice is whether the deferred deportation violates a dictate of the US Constitution that president must “ take care ” to “ faithfully execute ” the nation ’ s law Texas and the other state that brought the lawsuit say Obama in taking executive action that bypassed Congress crossed that line because Congress is in charge of deciding who is a lawful or unlawful immigrant The Obama administration say it wa faithfully executing the authority to determine priority under immigration law\",\n 'During Obama s campaigning in 2008 he spoke of his total devotion to the job a president

burden that any president I think strike with the American people is um you give me this office and in turn my fear doubt insecurity foible need for sleep family life vacation leisure is gone I am giving myself to you He continued The American people should have no patience for whatever is going through your head because you ve got a job to do How I think about it is um that you don t make that

Barack Obama ’ s bid to save his plan to spare million of immigrant in the country illegally from deportation and give them work permit ran into trouble on Monday at the US Supreme Court in a case testing the limit of presidential power The court with four conservative justice and four liberal seemed divided along ideological line during 90 minute of argument in the case brought by 26 state led by Texas that sued to block Obama ’ s unilateral 2014 executive action that bypassed Congress Liberal justice voiced support for Obama ’ s action The conservative sounded skeptical A 4-4 decision would be a grim defeat for Obama because it would uphold lower court ruling that threw out his action last year and doom his quest to revamp a US immigration policy he call broken More than a thousand people in favor of Obama ’ s action staged a raucous demonstration outside the white marble courthouse on a sunny spring day with cheery mariachi music from a red-and-black clad band filling the air A smaller group of Obama critic staged their own rally In order to win Obama would need the support of one of the court ’ s conservative most likely Chief Justice John Roberts or Anthony Kennedy But they both at time hit the Obama administration ’ s lawyer US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli with tough question Kennedy expressed concern that Obama had exceeded it authority by having the executive branch set immigration policy rather than carry out law passed by Congress “ It ’ s a if the president is setting the policy and the Congress is executing it That ’ s just upside down ” Kennedy said A ruling is due by the end of June Obama ’ s plan wa tailored to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010 have no criminal record and have child who are US citizen or lawful permanent resident - get into a program that shield them from deportation and supply work permit Obama said the program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents DAPA wa aimed at preventing family from being torn apart The case come during a heated presidential campaign in which the status of the roughly 11 million immigrant in the United States illegally most of them from Mexico and other Latin American nation ha been a central theme Immigration is also a global concern with Europe now struggling with a flood of immigrant fleeing violence in Syria Iraq and elsewhere The Republican-governed state that filed suit asserted that the Democratic president overstepped his authority provided in the Constitution while his administration said he merely provided guidance on how to enforce deportation law A 4-4 ruling is possible because there are only eight justice following February ’ s death of conservative Antonin Scalia One possible compromise outcome would be that the court could uphold Obama ’ s plan in part while leaving some legal question unresolved including whether the government can provide work permit to eligible applicant Obama would also win if the justice decide the state had no legitimate ground to sue Texas said it had “ standing ” to sue because it would be hurt by the additional cost it would incur by providing driver ’ s license to those given legal status Liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted the “ basic problem ” that the government lack the resource to deport everyone in the country illegally meaning it must set priority “ There are these people who are here to stay no matter what ” Ginsburg said Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized Texas ’ argument about the economic harm caused by Obama ’ s action saying million of immigrant “ are here in the shadow ” and will affect the economy “ whether we want them to or not ” Verrilli said the federal government ha regularly launched program aimed at giving large group of immigrant temporary legal status a part of it role establishing enforcement priority due to limited resource Asked by Roberts if the government ha the power to allow all immigrant who are in the country illegally to stay Verrilli said “ Definitely not ” Shortly before the plan wa to take effect a federal judge in Texas blocked it after the state filed suit The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision in November Obama ’ s executive action arose from frustration within the White House and the immigrant community about a lack of action in politically polarized Washington to address the status of people living in the United States illegally He took the action after House of Representatives Republicans killed bipartisan legislation called the biggest overhaul of US immigration law in decade and providing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrant that wa passed by the

gathering in Kentucky on Monday Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vented about how President Donald Trump s lack of political experience ha led to him setting excessive expectation for legislative prioritiesMcConnell R-Ky told the group in Florence that he found it extremely irritating that Congress ha earned the reputation of not accomplishing anything Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because in part the president and others have set these early timeline about thing need to be done by a certain point said McConnell a Republican and the state s senior senatorAccording to the latest Real Clear Politics poll Congress currently ha a 15 % approval rating and a 733 % disapproval rating There is no mention anywhere in the poll that President Trump is somehow responsible for Congress abysmal approval number Trump a political newcomer a McConnell noted ha a habit of declaring progress on major priority that do not necessarily reflect the reality of lawmakingFor example a the House wa in the midst of negotiation about it Obamacare replacement bill in February Trump announced that Congress wa in the final stage of it bill and said it would be ready for submitting in March While the House bill wa unveiled in March that chamber didn t vote on it until May and health care vote continued until the end of JulyThat sort of disconnect ha led to Trump s expressing disappointment when bill chief among them health care reform fail to end up on his desk even though a with health care the political reality indicated all along how difficult it wa going to be to pas legislation Our new president of course ha not been in this line of work before And I think he had excessive expectation about how quickly thing happen in the democratic process McConnell told the group So part of the reason I think people feel we re underperforming is because too many artificial deadline unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating may not have been fully understood ABC NewsWATCH',\n \"SHARE this everywhere REMEMBER WHEN THE MEDIA Breathlessly Chased Hillary s Scooby Van In Iowa ?

Easy We saw it comingNot everyone liked what we saw either In August 2012 the magazine American Conservative did an article on the film Occupy Unmasked That film wa directed by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Stephen K Bannon and featured people like Andrew Breitbart Brandon Darby and myself exposing the Occupy Wall Street movement for what it wa a socialist Obama-inspired activist movement We pointed out that Occupy wa the latest incarnation of the far-left anti-American protest movement that date back to the 1960s Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panthers We also said that the next step in the evolution of Occupy Wall Street would be race-basedBreitbart News ha given # BlackLivesMatter more detailed deep and honest coverage than any other medium outlet on the planet in 2015 and for good reason From covering every major protest they did to exposing the cop killer that the group worship to revealing the secret funder behind the movement to Milo Yiannopoulos s complete shredding of activist Shaun King Breitbart News ha been the go-to source for original reporting on Black Lives MatterAmerican Conservative took the film to task for using the term race war to describe what we saw a the next phase of the Occupy movement Remember Occupy Unmasked came out about a year before three self-described queer black woman started Black Lives Matter in July 2013 In 2012 Anita MonCrief wa mocked by American Conservative when she defended her use of the term race war in Occupy Unmasked by sayingBut seriously that s why you have Barack Obama out there saying if he had a son he would look like Trayvon Martin they want black people running around in hoodies protesting in the street That s what he s looking for He want u divided and he want u to fight in the street so they can basically keep u downMonCrief said this two year before the hoodie-wearing thug burned down Ferguson before they looted and set fire to Baltimore before they shut down Sen Bernie Sanders I-VT16 % at NetRoots nation and before they shut down Chicago s Magnificent Mile on the busiest shopping day of the yearAnita Moncrief is an amazing patriot who doesn t get enough credit for exposing the truth about the Left Watch her shocking testimony of how she became a conservative warrior hereThe assertion that Occupy Wall Street would morph into Black Lives Matter wasn t a lucky guess MonCrief Darby and I are all former leftist with professional organizational experience Anita wa a whistleblower who worked for ACORN Darby wa a cofounder of Common Ground in New Orleans and I did work for MoveOnorg and Brave New Films Because we understand the tactic and the player it wa clear to u that the Occupy movement and it focus on class had failed to resonate with a large enough segment of the American people We knew that the logical next step wa to head back to the 1960s playbook of trying to tear down America by creating a deep a racial rift a possibleWith Barack Obama in the White House and Eric Holder running the Department of Justice the stage wa set for the next iteration of the Occupy Wall Street movement Black Lives Matter wa the new OccupyWe also saw that community organizer were working on developing a new movement based on young black people in the wake of George Zimmerman s not guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin shooting case As I wrote at Breitbart News in July 2013 the takeover of the Florida statehouse by the group Dream Defenders wa a magnet for young people The long-term goal is straightforward and explicit the 2014 vote Once in the Capitol the Dream Defenders are giving the enthusiastic participant organizer training right in the governor s office With two generation of educator medium and legal expert all schooled in New Left political correctness by America s leading university the Black Lives Matter movement ha been essentially immune to criticism The result ha left university business and police department defenseless intellectually and physically against Black Lives MatterThere s been a practical cost a well We ve seen business burned to the ground in Ferguson and Baltimore We ve seen other business shut down at the Mall of America and on Chicago s Magnificent Mile We ve seen the murder rate spike in city across the country a a result of the Ferguson Effect that ha caused police officer to pull back from enforcing the law in the face of unrelenting hostility and scrutinyWe ve seen university from coast-to-coast bullied into staff firing and policy change that were meant to only aid black student These college uprising have been accompanied by a fierce hatred of free speech and when combined with the bold aggressiveness of multicultural and feminist Social Justice Warriors they ve created an educational environment that is openly hostile to white student and facultyWith the next presidential election only 11 month away conservative and Republicans would be making a huge mistake to ignore the Black Lives Matter movementAt the close of 2015 the pot is getting ready to boil over The decision not to prosecute Cleveland police officer in the shooting death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice the ongoing anger in Minneapolis over the death of Jamar Clark and two recent Chicago police shooting all create an atmosphere where even angier protest are in the worksAlready Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his Democrat machine regard Black Lives Matter activist a an existential threatThe engine that drive the anger is the mainstream medium which ha done nothing to seriously vet the Black Lives Matter movement Much of the anger is caused by the inaccurate reporting that consistently vilifies the police and leaf out key detail about the shooting victim This ha led to fable such a Hands Up Don t Shoot which have continued to be amplified and repeated by Black Lives Matter protester long after they have been debunkedIn fact one of the key characteristic of the Black Lives Matter movement and the mainstream medium s reporting on it is a naked antipathy for fact Both in real life and on social medium like Twitter leading Black Lives Matter activist are known for shutting down the speech of dissenting opinion and literally blocking anyone who disagrees with themThe result ha been a hermetically sealed activist movement that is angry and ignorant with a hairtrigger temper and a long list of grievance that have no factual basis Worse their set of crazed demand have been granted time and again by official who are too scared to speak out for fear of being branded racistsLike spoiled child none of this appeasement ha done anything to quell the protester fury Every time that politician or university administrator have given into the outrageous entitled Black Lives Matter mob they ve learned that feeding that monster ha only given it more power to make more demandsIn the face of all this feckless kowtowing no wonder the blunt and in-your-face style of billionaire Donald Trump ha hit home for so many Americans Trump like Ronald Reagan in the 1960s seems to be one of the few people in public life willing to tell Black Lives Matter protester to sit down shut up and stop taking the loser road of self-victimizationThis is one of the reason that Donald Trump more than any other political candidate on the scene right now ha incurred so much of the wrath and anger of Black Lives Matter They are keenly aware that he simply will not play their game The other current frontrunner for the Republican nomination is Texas Sen Ted Cruz R-TX97 % who ha already demonstrated that he is no cupcake either Should either Cruz or Trump be the nominee expect Black Lives Matter s army to take to the street and try to shut them down at every opportunityFor that reason the current political season is set to be even more divisive than either of the last two election cycle which had already set a very high bar for vitriolAs the newest incarnation of the activist Left Black Lives Matter will not back down or rest until it is either stopped by somone gutsy enough to call them out or until it get what it want a bloody revolution leading to a socialistanarchist AmericaThe one thing the left ha not counted on however is a dogged active conservative medium culture that can bring real information straight to the American people without being

State Attorney in Florida s Fourth Judicial Circuit Court encompassing Jacksonville Angela Corey wa trounced by almost unknown corporate attorney Melissa Nelson 64 to 26 percentHere s why that s goodAngela Corey is in the simplest term one of the most unethical cruel and heartless attorney in Florida and quite possibly the whole United States An eye-for-an-eye Republican Corey wa notorious for charging child a adult in the justice system According to Human Rights Watch 75 percent of the young people who were charged a adult under Corey s watch ended up going to prison and the disproportional number of these kid were black or Hispanic These statistic prove to be the highest in the state Contrast these statistic Corey s jurisdiction incarcerated 1475 juvenile in the Jacksonville area compared to 34 in Miami-Dade the most populated judicial district with higher rate of youth during the same time period 2009-2013Corey wa also the prosecutor who put Marissa Alexander in prison for firing a warning shot at her abusive husband According to The NationCorey charged Alexander with aggravated assault which carried a minimum sentence of 20 year in prison Corey sought a 60 year sentence Her prosecution of Alexander spurred online petition and protest from domestic-violence group who argued that Alexander wa being overcharged for protecting herself Alexander ultimately served three year in prison In an interview Corey told me that she didn t understand why her action were newsworthy arguing that Alexander had endangered her child who were in the next room How am I the bad guy in that situation ? she askedOne of her cruelest case involved Christian Fernandez a 12-year-old boy of Hispanic origin who beat his 2-year-old brother to death when she charged him a an adult Ignoring his past of extreme abuse Corey went ahead and and pressed for first-degree murder charge which would have put him away for the rest of his life Christian wa reported to have shoved his brother into a bookshelf injuring his head Fernandez s mother Biannela Susana waited too long before seeking medical attention and the boy slipped into a coma before dying A little boy who unintentionally killed his brother wa charged a an adult by a vengeful power- hungry prosecutor Luckily Christian Fernandez will not spend the rest of his life in prison pleaded a a juvenile to manslaughter and aggravated battery and will be sentenced to prison until he is 19 In a bit of irony Melissa Nelson wa one of the attorney who worked on Christian s caseIf Corey had her way this young boy would have never left prisonThen there wa perhaps the most famous case of them all the George Zimmerman trial Corey of course blew it While representing the state Corey had Zimmerman charged with second-degree murder which some felt wa an intentional overcharge and felt that manslaughter would have been better for a guilty verdict Corey also came under scrutiny for withholding information in relation to data accessed on Trayvon Martin s phone When it came to light that such information wa withheld Corey fired the employee responsible for releasing it Attorney Alan Dershowitz also accused Corey of filing a false andor misleading affidavit pertaining to the case a charge that could have gotten Corey disbarredNot only all of this Corey couldn t even uphold ethical standard that are beholden to attorney and those who are in officeCorey ha struggled to rise above several controversy in the run up to the primary some larger than others She wa accused of forcing her office staff to contribute to her campaign with their time and money A group of lawyer accused her of voter suppression and criticized by a group of vet for an alleged distorted campaign adCorey also used $ 108439 of taxpayer money to upgrade her pension plan and $ 425000 in bonus for her office staff Corey wa able to maneuver around a Florida statute than ban such bonus for public employee by claiming the disbursement were one time pay raisesSo the state of Florida made the right decision in sending a racist lying thieving prosecutor packing It remains to be seen how Corey s successor will handle case

avoidance if his party win Senate control in November targeting trillion of dollar in tax-deferred profit being held abroad by US company In an interview with Reuters Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said he want to put an end to a Kennedy-era law that let US corporation indefinitely hold profit from active business operation offshore without paying US tax on them Corporate tax avoidance is under trans-Atlantic assault The EU ha slapped a $ 145 billion back-taxes bill on Apple Inc Ten day ago the Obama administration imposed another in a series of recent clamp-downs on tax avoidance The idea of ending tax deferral of foreign profit ha been kicked around for year Wyden 67 is a long-time proponent and might finally be able to do something about it if voter support enough Senate Democrats in the Nov 8 election “ This is going to be front and center at the beginning of January ” said Wyden who is the top Democrat on the tax law-writing Senate Finance Committee The panel and the full Senate are presently controlled by Republicans Wyden said his first action if he becomes chairman will be to propose a funding package to upgrade US infrastructure It would require US company to bring home more than $ 2 trillion in foreign profit held offshore a part of an international tax reform package A previous tax “ holiday ” for profit held offshore wa tried in 2004 but wa voluntary not mandatory Under that program $ 360 billion in foreign profit wa “ repatriated ” at a discounted tax rate of 525 percent far below the statutory corporate income tax rate of 35 percent Wyden ha not specified a rate for his proposal Six year later with corporation pushing for another such holiday a congressional committee said the 2004 program had little economic impact and cost the US Treasury about $ 33 billion in lost revenue The tax reform Wyden envisions would also lower corporate tax rate and simplify the convoluted US tax code to prevent tax planner from “ gaming ” the system The code ha not been thoroughly overhauled in 30 year “ The first bill out of the gate would be road and bridge and transportation ” Wyden told Reuters on Friday “ My sense is that there will be an interest among member in using a portion of the money derived from international reform for the road and bridge and transportation system ” Most multinationals and many lawmaker both Republicans and some Democrats favor a foreign profit repatriation program but not like the one Wyden want The United States ha a “ worldwide ” corporate income tax system that tax profit of US company no matter where they are made with some exception One is that earnings from active business operation a opposed to passive income such a rent or royalty can be left offshore on a tax-free basis under the Kennedy-era deferral rule Passive income is taxed In contrast most large country have “ territorial ” system in which company pay income tax only to the government of the country where the profit were made Corporate America ha been lobbying for many year for a territorial system that would make deferral obsolete Wyden and other Democrats want to keep a worldwide system and eliminate deferral a position singled out for criticism last week by House Speaker Paul Ryan “ The fear I have is the progressive who kind of control the Democratic Party don ’ t think anything close to what look like tax reform is a good thing ” Ryan told the Economic Club of New York “ I hope that view change ” But Wyden say the public is unlikely to accept a system under which US corporation do not pay tax on foreign profit “ At a time when Americans are so angry about job being shipped overseas I don ’ t think it ’ s going to go over very well ” he said “ A competitive rate no deferral and no gaming I ’ m going to argue get you the benefit of territorial ” Some Republicans also oppose tying tax reform to infrastructure Wyden say failing to reform the tax code could strain US relation with the European Union if EU state aid probe continue to penalize US company possibly resulting in US action before the World Trade Organization “ To Democrats and Republicans this feel more like the European Commission declaring open season on the American tax base than them joining u to fight tax dodger ” he said “ I could see member saying the United States should respond with a WTO case ” Wyden added “ There ’ s that kind of anger ”',\n

statement belowStatement for the Record Senate Select Committee on Intelligence James B Comey June 8 2017Chairman Burr Ranking Member Warner Members of the Committee Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today I wa asked to testify today to describe for you my interaction with President-Elect and President Trump on subject that I understand are of interest to you I have not included every detail from my conversation with the President but to the best of my recollection I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the CommitteeJanuary 6 BriefingI first met then-President-Elect Trump on Friday January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York I wa there with other Intelligence Community IC leader to brief him and his new national security team on the finding of an IC assessment concerning Russian effort to interfere in the election At the conclusion of that briefing I remained alone with the President-Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspect of the information assembled during the assessmentThe IC leadership thought it important for a variety of reason to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material even though it wa salacious and unverified Among those reason were 1 we knew the medium wa about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and it imminent release from the President-Elect and 2 to the extent there wa some effort to compromise an incoming President we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefingThe Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I wa staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBI s counter-intelligence responsibility We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the President-Elect Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing the FBI s leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI wa conducting a counter-intelligence investigation of his personal conductIt is important to understand that FBI counter-intelligence investigation are different than the more-commonly known criminal investigative work The Bureau s goal in a counter-intelligence investigation is to understand the technical and human method that hostile foreign power are using to influence the United States or to steal our secret The FBI us that understanding to disrupt those effort Sometimes disruption take the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked Sometimes it involves turning the recruited person into a double-agent or publicly calling out the behavior with sanction or expulsion of embassy-based intelligence officer On occasion criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activitiesBecause the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known counterintelligence investigation tend to be centered on individual the FBI suspect to be witting or unwitting agent of that foreign power When the FBI develops reason to believe an American ha been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting a an agent of the foreign power the FBI will open an investigation on that American and use legal authority to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disruptedIn that context prior to the January 6 meeting I discussed with the FBI s leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure President-Elect Trump that we were not investigating him personally That wa true we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him We agreed I should do so if circumstance warranted During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower based on President-Elect Trump s reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question I offered that assuranceI felt compelled to document my first conversation with the President-Elect in a memo To ensure accuracy I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting Creating written record immediately after one-on-one conversation with Mr Trump wa my practice from that point forward This had not been my practice in the past I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person and never on the phone once in 2015 to discus law enforcement policy issue and a second time briefly for him to say goodbye in late 2016 In neither of those circumstance did I memorialize the discussion I can recall nine one-on-one conversation with President Trump in four month three in person and six on the phoneJanuary 27 DinnerThe President and I had dinner on Friday January 27 at 630 pm in the Green Room at the White House He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night saying he wa going to invite my whole family but decided to have just me this time with the whole family coming the next time It wa unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner although I assumed there would be othersIt turned out to be just the two of u seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room Two Navy steward waited on u only entering the room to serve food and drinksThe President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on a FBI Director which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversation that he hoped I would stay and I had assured him that I intended to He said that lot of people wanted my job and given the abuse I had taken during the previous year he would understand if I wanted to walk awayMy instinct told me that the one-on-one setting and the pretense that this wa our first discussion about my position meant the dinner wa at least in part an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship That concerned me greatly given the FBI s traditionally independent status in the executive branchI replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my ten-year term a Director And then because the set-up made me uneasy I added that I wa not reliable in the way politician use that word but he could always count on me to tell him the truth I added that I wa not on anybody s side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense a stance I said wa in his best interest a the PresidentA few moment later the President said I need loyalty I expect loyalty I didn t move speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed We simply looked at each other in silence The conversation then moved on but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinnerAt one point I explained why it wa so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House I said it wa a paradox Throughout history some Presidents have decided that because problem come from Justice they should try to hold the Department close But blurring those boundary ultimately make the problem worse by undermining public trust in the institution and their workNear the end of our dinner the President returned to the subject of my job saying he wa very glad I wanted to stay adding that he had heard great thing about me from Jim Mattis Jeff Sessions and many others He then said I need loyalty I replied You will always get honesty from me He paused and then said That s what I want honest loyalty I paused and then said You will get that from me As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner it is possible we understood the phrase honest loyalty differently but I decided it wouldn t be productive to push it further The term honest loyalty had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanation had made clear what he should expectDuring the dinner the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6 and a he had done previously expressed his disgust for the allegation and strongly denied them He said he wa considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn t happen I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally which we weren t and because it wa very difficult to prove a negative He said he would think about it and asked me to think about itAs wa my practice for conversation with President Trump I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBIFebruary 14 Oval Office MeetingOn February 14 I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President He sat behind the desk and a group of u sat in a semi-circle of about six chair facing him on the other side of the desk The Vice President Deputy Director of the CIA Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center Secretary of Homeland Security the Attorney General and I were in the semi-circle of chair I wa directly facing the President sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC There were quite a few others in the room sitting behind u on couch and chairsThe President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone I stayed in my chair As the participant started to leave the Oval Office the Attorney General lingered by my chair but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me The last person to leave wa Jared Kushner who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantry with me The President then excused him saying he wanted to speak with meWhen the door by the grandfather clock closed and we were alone the President began by saying I want to talk about Mike Flynn Flynn had resigned the previous day The President began by saying Flynn hadn t done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President He added that he had other concern about Flynn which he did not then specifyThe President then made a long series of comment about the problem with leak of classified information a concern I shared and still share After he had spoken for a few minute about leak Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him The President waved at him to close the door saying he would be done shortly The door closedThe President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn saying He is a good guy and ha been through a lot He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his call with the Russians but had misled the Vice President He then said I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go He is a good guy I hope you can let this go I replied only that he is a good guy In fact I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he wa a colleague a Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI I did not say I would let this go The President returned briefly to the problem of leak I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock making my way through the large group of people waiting there including Mr Priebus and the Vice PresidentI immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statement about his conversation with the Russian ambassador in December I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible link to his campaign I could be wrong but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone call Regardless it wa very concerning given the FBI s role a an independent investigative agencyThe FBI leadership team agreed with me that it wa important not to infect the investigative team with the President s request which we did not intend to abide We also concluded that given that it wa a one-on-one conversation there wa nothing available to corroborate my account We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia-related investigation He did so two week later The Deputy Attorney General s role wa then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney who would also not be long in the roleAfter discussing the matter we decided to keep it very closely held resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road a our investigation progressed The investigation moved ahead at full speed with none of the investigative team member or the Department of Justice lawyer supporting them aware of the President s requestShortly afterwards I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pas along the President s concern about leak I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me I told the AG that what had just happened him being asked to leave while the FBI Director who report to the AG remained behind wa inappropriate and should never happen He did not reply For the reason discussed above I did not mention that the President broached the FBI s potential investigation of General FlynnMarch 30 Phone CallOn the morning of March 30 the President called me at the FBI He described the Russia investigation a a cloud that wa impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country He said he had nothing to do with Russia had not been involved with hooker in Russia and had always assumed he wa being recorded when in Russia He asked what we could do to lift the cloud I responded that we were investigating the matter a quickly a we could and that there would be great benefit if we didn t find anything to our having done the work well He agreed but then re-emphasized the problem this wa causing himThen the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week at which I had a the Department of Justice directed confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign I explained the demand from the leadership of both party in Congress for more information and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individual we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leader that we were not personally investigating President Trump I reminded him I had previously told him that He repeatedly told me We need to get that fact out I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statement that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reason most importantly because it would create a duty to correct should that changeThe President went on to say that if there were some satellite associate of his who did something wrong it would be good to find that out but that he hadn t done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren t investigating himIn an abrupt shift he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe saying he hadn t brought up the McCabe thing because I had said McCabe wa honorable although McAuliffe wa close to the Clintons and had given him I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe s wife campaign money Although I didn t understand why the President wa bringing this up I repeated that Mr McCabe wa an honorable personHe finished by stressing the cloud that wa interfering with his ability to make deal for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn t being investigated I told him I would see what we could do and that we would do our investigative work well and a quickly a we couldImmediately after that conversation I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all Russia-related matter to report the substance of the call from the President and said I would await his guidance I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two week laterApril 11 Phone CallOn the morning of April 11 the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General but I had not heard back He replied that the cloud wa getting in the way of his ability to do his job He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General I said that wa the way his request should be handled I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request which wa the traditional channelHe said he would do that and added Because I have been very loyal to you very loyal we had that thing you know I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing I said only that the way to handle it wa to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General He said that wa what he would do and the call endedThat wa the last time I spoke with President Trump',\n 'NEW YORK Reuters - US money manager with reinsurance company in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands could lose a valuable loophole under Republican proposal to overhaul

because Russian medium is covering Donald Trump more than him and he only ha himself to blameOver the course of the election Putin ordered Russian state medium to endorse and positively cover Trump s

Trump weakening NATO by pulling American support Russia ha also been getting really aggressive by simulating air attack on a United States Navy destroyer and they have a spy ship parked really close to our shoreline Russia ha also deployed cruise missile in violatio of a treaty And if that s not enough Trump is still expected to lift sanction placed on RussiaThe Kremlin is currently enjoying the fact that Trump ha a bunch of pro-Russia staffer in his administration and Russian medium love that fact a well So they have continued lavishing Trump with the kind of praise and ego-stroking that American medium outlet refuse to provideBut Russian medium won t be doing nearly a much now because Putin is reportedly tired of waiting for Trump to do his bidding and he is jealous of the medium coverage Trump ha been receivingThat s right The honeymoon appears to be coming to an end between Trump and Putin at least when it come to how much Russian medium cover himAccording to Bloomberg In January Trump received more mention in the medium than Putin relegating the Russian leader to the No 2 spot for the first time since he returned to the Kremlin in 2012 after four year a premier according to Interfax data And so Putin ha apparently ordered the Russian medium to tone down their coverage of Trump so that Putin can get more coverage for himself They won t pour bucket of criticism on Trump they just won t talk about him much Russian journalist Konstantin von Eggert told Bloomberg The fate of Russia-American relation is much le predictable than it wa just a few week ago Indeed a few week ago it looked certain that Trump would be able to get away with helping his buddy Putin take advantage of the United States Now that Michael Flynn ha busted Trump s connection with Russia wide open and Congress continues to discus investigating the tie Putin is not a confident Trump is the puppet he wa looking forBut Americans should remain vigilant Donald Trump is still in office and until he is ousted permanently he will continue to be a threat to our national security Putin could merely be making it appear like he and Trump are having a spat He could be simply working behind the scene or waiting until Trump s Russia scandal dy downHowever it s still damn hilarious that Putin is jealous of the medium coverage his BFF is getting in his own backyard Apparently Putin

vagina otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voter Hillary Clinton is facing more question about her close tie to Wall Street financial institution Last week the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcript of her highly-compensated speech to Wall Street firm Goldman SachsThe paid speech are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titan According to Clinton Foundation record Wall Street financial institution have donated around $ 40 million to the eponymous family foundationAs a non-profit the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose it donor or contribution The Foundation ha publicly disclosed some contribution on it website It only provides range for contribution eg $ 1-5 million and doesn t detail when the contribution wa made or for what purpose if anyHere s the chart of contribution from Wall Street to the Clinton FoundationAll together contribution from readily identifiable Wall Street institution to the Foundation total somewhere between $ 11 million and $ 41 million in contribution If we assume the donation fall in the middle of the range disclosed by the Clinton Foundation the contribution would total just under $ 30 millionAs with most thing involving the Clintons the devil is in the detail This total of contribution doe not include those made by individual with strong Wall Street tie It also doe not necessarily represent the total amount contributed to the Foundation from those donor listed It only account for the donation which the Foundation ha chosen to discloseThe failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donation is especially worrisome In term of donor relationship there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $ 1 million and an ongoing gift of $ 200000 for 5 straight year The total dollar amount may be the same but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donorThere is of course an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons During the life of the Foundation Hillary Clinton ha been a US Senator Secretary of State and two-time candidate for PresidentWhen the Clinton Foundation discloses that the Friends of Saudi Arabia contributed $ 1-5 million it begs the obvious question of when that donation wa made The specific date of that donation is particularly important given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she wa Secretary of StateIt is also important to note that these contribution are completely seperate from the paid speech made by Bill and Hillary Clinton In 2013 alone Hillary earned just over $ 3 million in paid speech to financial firm and institutionsThese contribution obviously also don t include direct contribution made by Wall

give the impression of being unfair When Francisco Javier Chavez posted bail on charge of beating a California toddler within an inch of her life in late July there wa little reason to expect the illegal immigrant who ha spent much of his adult life hopping back and forth across the Mexican border would return to face justiceTwo week later at his scheduled arraignment on Aug 13 Chavez wa a no-show The 27-year-old career criminal had put up $ 10000 or 10 percent of the amount set for his alleged crime by California s bail schedule His disappearance is hardly a surprise to critic who believe violent illegal immigrant are by definition flight risk who should be denied bail in such serious case They say judge especially in border state plagued by illegal immigrant crime are naive or worse if they expect suspect who regularly cross in and out of Mexico to take the US justice system seriously Frankly judge grant bail in case like these because they are being foolish said Hans A von Spakovsky a former Justice Department lawyer now at The Heritage Foundation s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies The judge can consider bail for you when you are charged with a crime but doe not have to let you out on bail If the state can show you are a flight risk you should not get bail If the state can show you are a danger to the public because of a history of violence you should not get bail Frankly judge grant bail in case like these because they are being foolish While Chavez is in the wind his alleged victim the 2-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend is now in foster care paralyzed from the beating that also left her with both arm and a femur brokenWell before he wa arrested in San Luis Obispo County for attacking the child Chavez had compiled a lengthy criminal record that includes assault and drug conviction and arrest for violent act such a kidnapping car-jacking and cruelty to a child He wa deported in February 2014 but a in previous instance found it easy to sneak back across the border and into the US Francisco Javier Chavez l posted bail and ha not been seen again after allegedly beating a toddler Jose Enrique Vasquez r wa accused of killing a child but could be freed if he post bailWeeks after Chavez slipped out of custody on Sept 1 another 2-year-old toddler named Jonathan Montez wa run down and killed in San Bernardino County Illegal immigrant Jose Enrique Vasquez 53 an unlicensed driver who witness said wa speeding down the child s residential street fled the scene according to authority He wa arrested two week later and like Chavez wa granted bailVasquez also ha compiled a lengthy criminal record under various alias including charge of spousal abuse battery of a peace officer driving without a license driving under the influence and armed robbery But other charge in his criminal record might have given a judge pause in considering bail according to critic including failure to appear in court possession of false citizenship document and eight deportation for illegally entering the countryThe system for granting bail in state court varies from state to state California s bail system lay out prescribed amount for various crime a a guideline for law enforcement and judge but judge retain discretion to raise the amount in case where the suspect is a flight risk or a danger to the public and the district attorney can add drop or change the charge Two state Alabama and Missouri have passed law that preclude bail for illegal immigrant suspected of serious crime while judge in other state notably Texas weigh illegal status in making their decision But last year the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Arizona s 2006 law banning bail for illegal immigrant suspect violated their right to due process and amounted to punishment before trial The 11-member panel s decision called the law a scattered attempt to deal with the problem of chronic bail-skipping by illegal immigrant Earlier this year the US Supreme Court declined to consider the lower court s decisionJudges everywhere maintain discretion to deny bail to anyone they believe is likely to flee justice yet they often fail to consider illegal status a a factor said Jessica Vaughan director of policy study for the Center for Immigration Studies And critic say it should be obvious that someone here illegally and suspected of a violent crime will bolt rather than face justice especially in border state such a California where they can be out of the country an hour after posting bail Aliens who commit act of violence should not be released on bail because they are clearly a danger to the public and when we have someone with this kind of deportation history clearly they are an obvious flight risk said von Spakovsky These judge are making mistake granting bail to illegal alien reckless mistake that endangered the public The willingness of judge to grant bail to illegal immigrant charged with serious crime compound the ongoing controversy involving so-called sanctuary city Such jurisdiction either by local statute or practice refuse to inform federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent when an illegal immigrant is detainedBut even jurisdiction that do not implement sanctuary policy believe that two federal court ruling the 2013 California Trust Act which limit cruel and costly immigration hold request in local jail and an ambiguous White House policy all bar them from holding illegal immigrant who have posted bail until federal authority can collect and deport them even if ICE asks them to via what is known a a detainer request The American Civil Liberties Union ha sued jurisdiction that attempted to honor the ICE detainers and the Department of Justice ha not intervened in the case to underscore it support of them As a result local law enforcement agency say they have no choice but to let even violent illegal immigrant suspect walk once they

weighed down one pile Since taking office in May the former investment banker and civil servant ha been meticulous in managing his image talking about the need to ensure the presidency is elevated dealing solemnly with the weightiest issue of the day At the same time he ha insisted that he is not a president of the rich a critic have labeled him but in touch with ordinary citizen via frequent visit to factory business fair and market The obsessiveness about how he come across ha also tripped him up He wa ridiculed for dressing up in an olive flight suit to address the military and three

issue French journalist have expressed frustration that he doe not make himself more available for interview or at press conference something his predecessor Francois Hollande did all too regularly sometimes responding to text message Instead those around Macron describe the need to be Jupiterian taking big decision from on high rather than getting caught in the melee of daily journalism During Sunday s interview Macron rejected criticism that he had been dismissive towards unionist saying his use of word like slacker and the phrase kicking up a bloody mess to describe protester were him telling it straight We re taking care of the part of France where thing aren t going so well he said I m doing what I said I would do during the election campaign Throughout the interview Macron wa polite but combative unwilling to cede the word to his questioner and at time turning the event into a lengthy policy presentation He talked repeatedly of long-term vision rather than quick result Some reviewer criticized the failure to elicit news Macron s concern for image wa evident immediately after his election victory - that evening he crossed the courtyard of the Louvre to the strain of Beethoven s Ode To Joy the official anthem of the European Union A fly-on-the-wall documentary released the next day told the inside story of his campaign largely painting the thrusting president in a positive light But whether his approach can win over more of the public than the 24 percent who voted for him in the first round of the election is questionable While 97 million people tuned in to watch on Sunday a poll by Harris Interactive showed 61 percent were not convinced by what he said especially on social issue',\n 'When a Muslim man with dual citizenship in Egypt and America tell his fellow agent A Muslim doesn t record another Muslim and get a promotion every American should be concerned When that same Muslim is in an advisory role in our government and is advocating for a federal gun registry every American should be very concerned A Muslim doesn t record another Muslim said Gamal Abdel-Hafiz shown This might not have been noteworthy except that Abdel-Hafiz wa an FBI agent at the time and wa refusing to do his duty which at that moment involved taping a Muslim suspect That wa 2002 and this is now And now the Cairo-born Abdel-Hafiz ha moved on to bigger and perhaps better thing he s a homeland-security advisor to Barack Obama And while recording a single Muslim is a problem for him putting every single American firearm owner on a gun-registry he fancy a good idea WFAAcom report on his idea A former FBI counter-terrorism agent say lawmaker could make mass murder le likely What we need to do is keep the ownership of gun known to the government so we know who ha what said security consultant Gamal Abdel-Hafiz And I know a lot of people are against that He shouldn t have been able to buy a gun legally He shouldn t said Abdel-Hafiz about 29 year-old Omar Mateen the Orlando jihadist He say 3 FBI interview should have been enough to keep Mateen on the radar but he also know why he wasn t Once you investigate someone and clear them you have to remove them from the watch list by law he explained Monday from his office in DallasAnd even if Mateen had been on a terror watch list or no-fly list that would not have prohibited him from legally buying weapon That mean the list is useless then the former agent saidResponding to this PJ Media note Remarkably he Abdel-Hafiz admits that the various terror watch list and no-fly list are useless Moments after suggesting another list He doesn t explain how a national gun registry yet another government list targeting million of law-abiding Americans would prevent another terror attack For sure All car owner are registered but that doesn t guarantee they re all sane and doesn t stop me if I am unhinged from plowing my vehicle into a group on a sidewalk Likewise let s say all legal firearm in America were registered Then what ? Given that the list Mateen already wa on ultimately had no remedial effect in his case how would the FBI having knowledge of his weapon purchase have stopped his Orlando malevolence ? We don t have to wonder though because the FBI already knew about them As Breitbart reported last week Robbie Abell owner of a Florida gun shop say he alerted authority that a suspicious man had come in asking about body armor The Wall Street Journal quote Abell a telling them that his store Lotus Gunworks of South Florida shut him down on all sale after he began asking bizarre question about body armor and bulk ammunition The question he wa asking were not the normal question a normal person would be asking He just seemed very odd Abell said The armor Mateen asked about is not traditionally available to civiliansIn addition Abell witnessed Mateen talking on a phone in what the gun dealer believed wa Arabic In other word Mateen fit the terrorist profile like a glove yet this wasn t enough to inspire the FBI to take the glove off And now we re supposed to believe that somehow some way information about innocent American gun owner will help an agency that lacked the wisdom to act on already available information about a dangerous un-American gun owner ? Shockingly Abdel-Hafiz wa never fired by the FBI This is despite allegation he perpetrated insurance fraud and then lied about it to the agency despite his I won t record another Muslim remark and despite the fact that a colleague of his FBI special agent Robert Wright and Chicago federal prosecutor Mark Flessner both attest that the Muslim agent seriously damaged the investigation inspiring the remark Instead here s what did transpire a reported by ABC News in 2002Wright said he wa floored by Abdel-Hafiz s refusal and immediately called the FBI headquarters Their reaction surprised him even more The supervisor from headquarters say Well you have to understand where he s coming from Bob I said no no no no no I understand where I m coming from said Wright We both took the same damn oath to defend this country against all enemy foreign and domestic and he just said no ? No way in hell Far from being reprimanded Abdel-Hafiz wa promoted to one of the FBI s most important anti-terrorism post the American Embassy in Saudi Arabia to handle investigation for the FBI in that Muslim countryOf course there are no allegation that Abdel-Hafiz who ha dual AmericanEgyptian citizenship ha commissively aided terrorist But given his infamous 2002 refusal to perform his duty some question must be asked In what other way diddoes Abdel-Hafiz s Muslim faith constrain or even warp his action with respect to Muslim terrorist ? How is it influencing his advice ? And how many of his theological soul mate are today working in intelligence agency ?

Donald Trump isn t busy insulting Gold Star family or inciting his follower to assassinate his presidential opponent he spends a lot of time talking about the dreadful Obama economy one in which admittedly growth is slow A new study though show that Trump is pointing his stumpy finger in the wrong direction The blame lie squarely with his Republican partyThe report wa published by the Economic Policy Institute It blame Republican austerity not Democratic spending for the fact that economic growth wa just 12 percent during the second quarter and frankly it hasn t been spectacular for a long time It s easy to blame the man in the White House which is what Republicans do but they are wrongThe EPI place the blame on 2011 s Republican budget cut fiscal austerity at the state and local level GOP state refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act Instead of cutting spending during the recovery from the Great Recession we should have been spending more specifically on infrastructure and on program that help peopleThis economic recovery ha been the slowest over the past four business cycle For example the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to it pre-recession peak took 51 month Following the recession in the 1980s employment recovery took 11 month In the early 1990s it took 23 month and in the early 2000s it took 39 monthsThe US government would have had to spend an additional $ 1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession Bivens said While such spending might run up the US deficit something Republicans in Congress are opposed to it would also have led to several year of full employment and the Federal Reserve increasing interest ratesSource The GuardianAnother problem is the low interest rate During the recovery from the 80 recession the interest rate started at 93 percent Now with interest rate approaching 0 percent and have been for a long time there s no place to move themThe study doe place some blame on the Obama administration though He didn t make effective enough use of the bully pulpitThe Obama administration could have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete identifiable root in decision made by the Congress Bivens wrote Had the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity wa hampering growth it could have

Reuters - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton on Sunday dismissed the notion of a contested nominating convention and said she wa not preparing for such a scenario after her rival for her party ’ s presidential nomination racked up another victory Bernie Sanders won the Wyoming caucus on Saturday his seventh victory over Clinton in the last eight Democratic nominating contest a the two gear up for a crucial matchup on April 19 in New York state Sanders a US senator from Vermont is trying to chip away at Clinton ’ s big lead in the number of delegate needed to secure the Democratic nomination for the Nov 8 presidential election He said on Sunday he believed he could close the gap and left the door open for a so-called floor flight at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia in July if neither ha won an outright majority of delegate In that case a system of multiple ballot take place governed by complex rule with candidate hoping to persuade delegate to vote for them Asked on CNN if she were preparing for such a scenario Clinton said “ No I intend to have the number of delegate that are required to be nominated ” The former US secretary of state said she wa leading Sanders by 25 million popular vote and in pledged delegate “ I feel good about the upcoming contest and I expect to be the nominee ” she said The specter of a contested convention a relatively rare event in recent US politics loom much larger in the Republican race While front-runner Donald Trump ha amassed a delegate lead by winning many state contest rival Ted Cruz ha proved tenacious in pursuit of every last delegate available by other mean Cruz ’ s campaign ha worked hard in state where the delegate allocation process is more complex such a Colorado where the US senator from Texas garnered 34 delegate on Saturday The Trump campaign ha complained about the nominating process including in Louisiana where the New York billionaire Trump won the vote but split the delegate equally with Cruz “ It ’ s a crooked system ” Trump said at a large rally in Rochester New York on Sunday before saying the process wa broken in both major party and expressing sympathy for Sanders “ Look at Bernie He win and win and win ” Trump said he had warned the Republican National Committee there would be a “ big problem ” if he doe not become the nominee “ We ’ re supposed to be a democracy We ’ re supposed to be You vote and it mean something ” Paul Manafort the veteran political strategist Trump hired to oversee his delegate operation accused the Cruz campaign of bullying delegate into backing the senator something the Trump campaign planned to protest “ Well he ’ s threatening you go to these county convention and you see the tactic Gestapo tactic the scorched-earth tactic ” Manafort said on NBC ’ s ‘ Meet the Press ’ Clinton wa campaigning in Baltimore on Sunday where she received the endorsement of US Representative Elijah Cummings ahead of Maryland ’ s nominating contest on April 25 where another 95 delegate are at stake The Wyoming result did not change the delegate math for the Democratic contender Each won seven since delegate are awarded proportionally based on caucus-goers ’ support Going into Wyoming Clinton had more than half of the 2383 delegate needed to win the nomination Sanders trailed her by 250 pledged delegate those awarded based on the result of the state nominating contest But Sanders said future contest in the West and on the East Coast looked favorable to him including New York Pennsylvania California and Oregon “ We believe that we have the momentum We believe that the polling is showing that we ’ re closing the gap ” Sanders said on Sunday on ABC ’ s “ This Week ” Sanders sidestepped question on whether he wa prepared to take the nomination to a floor fight if Clinton did not win the magic number of pledged delegate but he left the possibility open “ If neither candidate end up you know having the kind of vote they need yes I think there will be some discussion ” Sanders said on CNN ’ s “ State of the Union ” An inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Clinton ’ s use of a private email

3-million-gallon heavy-metal spill two week ago in Silverton polluted three state and touched off national outrage But the EPA escaped public wrath in 2005 when it secretly dumped up to 15000 ton of poisonous waste into another mine 124 mile away That dump containing arsenic lead and other material materialized in runoff in the town of Leadville said Todd Hennis who owns both mine along with numerous others If a private company had done this they would ve been fined out of existence Hennis said I have been battling the EPA for 10 year and they have done nothing but create pollution About 20 percent of Silverton resident think it s on purpose so they can declare the whole area a Superfund site Like Silverton to the south Leadville wa founded in the late 1800s a a mining town and is the only municipality in it county Today tourism is it livelihoodIt s against this backdrop that the Environmental Protection Agency began lobbying to declare part of Leadville a Superfund site in order to develop a recreational area called the Mineral Belt Trail The project wa officially completed in 2000 but apparently the agency stayed on and continued to work in townIn late 2005 the EPA collected ton of sludge from two Leadville mine and secretly dumped it down the shaft of the New Mikado mine without notifying Hennis it owner according to document reviewed by WatchdogA drainage tunnel had been installed at the bottom of the mine shaft by the US government in 1942 meaning that any snow or rain would leach toxin into the surrounding landHennis said the EPA claim it ha installed a treatment pond near the tunnel to clean runoff The EPA rebuffed his demand to clean up the mess it created in his mine he said In frustration Hennis sent the county sheriff a certified notice that any EPA official found near his property were trespassing and should be arrestedDespite that history of bitterness in 2010 the EPA asked Hennis to grant it agent access to Gold King Mine in Silverton because the agency wa investigating hazardous runoff from other mine in the region I said No I don t want you on my land out of fear that you will create additional pollution like you did in Leadville Hennis said The official request turned into a threat Hennis said They said If you don t give u access within four day we will fine you $ 35000 a day An EPA administrative order dated May 12 2011 said it inspector wanted to conduct drilling of hole and installing monitoring well sampling and monitoring water soil and mine waste material from mine water rock dump a necessary to evaluate release of hazardous substance When the EPA hit Hennis with $ 300000 in fine he said he waved the white flag and allowed the agency on his propertySo for the past four year the EPA ha been working at the mine and two others nearby all which border a creek that funnel into the Animas River One mine to the north had been walled off with cement by it owner but it continued to leak water into Gold King The EPA installed a drainage ditch on the Gold King side of the mine to alleviate the problem but then accidentally filled the ditch with dirt and rock last summer while building a water-retention wallThat wa the wall that burst when a contractor punched a hole in the top on Aug 5 sending a bright orange stream cascading down The EPA looked like the Keystone Kops a anger intensified in the medium and general public 24 hour passed with no notification to the lower state or Navajo Nation the White House ignored mentioning the incident and it took a week for the EPA administrator to tour Durango downstream while refusing to visit Silverton itselfThe EPA say cleaning pond have been installed to leach toxin from the water and claim that anything released now is actually cleaner than before the spill occurred The fallout from this disaster in the lower state is still unknownAlso unknown is the fate of Silverton itself For month the EPA ha been pushing town leader into allowing designation a a Superfund site out of belief that the whole town is contaminated This is something the town ha resisted a it reputation is at stake and no current test have shown any evidence of toxic soil level Whenever we hear the word EPA we think of Superfund said Silverton Town Board Trustee David Zanoni They say We want to work together That s BS They want to come in and take over The water up here is naturally filled with mineral They don t need to be here cleaning up If the EPA s litany of mistake at Gold King mine is a barometer Zanoni said handing over the rein of Silverton would be a disaster

why Jill Stein ha raised enough money to trigger a recount in three battleground statesOn December 19th the elector will meet to cast their vote for president and vice-president And when they do they have a chance to put the rightful winner of the 2016 Election in the White HouseAccording to Lessig the Electoral College is not meant to deny a reasonable judgment by the people It is meant to be a circuit breaker just in case the people go crazy In this election the people did not go crazy The winner by far of the popular vote is the most qualified candidate for president in more than a generation Like her or not no elector could have a good-faith reason to vote against her because of her qualification Choosing her is thus plainly within the bound of a reasonable judgment by the people The framer left the elector free to choose They should exercise that choice by leaving the election a the people decided it in Clinton s favorIn short elector need to do the right and moral

SELFIE OBSESSED SHOOTER Omar Mateen is the alleged Orlando nightclub shooter Image Source nbcnewsQUESTION Is this is another in a long line of Daily Shooter event designed to evoke an emotive polarized and highly politicized response rather than a rational and reasoned one ? The Orlando ShootingIn the early hour of Sunday June 12th Omar Mir Seddique Mateen also listed a Omar Mateen by medium outlet wa said to have killed 49 people wounding some 53 others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando Florida in what is being described a the deadliest mass shooting in AmericaAccording report Mateen is also said to have pledged allegiance to ISIS via a 911 call while carrying out the apparent large scale mass shooting and hostage situation having been utterly cool and calm a suggested by some larger medium outlet upon finishing his rampageRELATED VIDEO Active Shooter and Terror Drills The Truth WILL Shock YouAdditionally Mateen wa first stated to have used an AR-15 rifle along with a small handgun legally obtained through two security license However report later changed and updated the alleged shooter s weapon of choice to the Sig Sauer MCX 223 caliber rifle and a Glock 17 9mm semi-auto pistolThe following is an extensive Rand Corporation evaluation of the NYPD and it reveals the following statistic a they relate to firearm accuracy According to a 2008 Rand Corporation study evaluating the New York Police Department s firearm training between 1998 and 2006 the average hit rate during gunfight wa just 18 percent When suspect did not return fire police officer hit their target 30 percent of the time21WIRE wa able to track down an individual trained in all type of firearm training who also questioned the alleged shooter s ability to to be so accurate confirming the study aboveContinuing the Orlando shooting timeline We were then told Mateen took club goer hostage while carrying out the alleged terror related shooting around 2amThe shooting occurred at Pulse nightclub a popular LGTB venue wa thought to have had some 300 people inside of the club during the time of the shooting We ve also been told that authority were unable to stop the gunman for until 3 hour after the initial attackThe Washington Post reported Three hour after Mateen first began shooting they breached the building detonating an explosion on an exterior wall and ramming it with an armored vehicle Traumatized club-goers escaped into the night and then the gunman appeared in the opening heavily armed and seemingly ready for what is known in law enforcement a suicide by cop While some 30 life have said to have been saved how many were injured due to the explosive charge set of by police during the breach ? According to a timeline of event police were able to notify 24 of the victim family just two hour after the shooting at 730 am This appears to be a significant detail when you consider the meticulous nature of crime scene investigation a detective are tasked with the time consuming and often difficult process of properly identifying individualsIn the Orlando shooting case there would have particularly in this scenario been great bodily harm and perhaps unrecognizable victim who may or may not have had proper ID fake ID s on their person during the shootingThere appears to be a lack of footage surrounding the shooting itself rescue operation performed or body at the stated crime scene extremely strange in the age of social medium SHOW OF FORCE A full-scale militarized response to the Pulse crime scene shooting Did club goer become victim of friendly fire or wa something else at play ? Image Source radaronlineThe Times Union stated the following after the Pulse nightclub shooting Orlando police Chief John Mina say an extra officer wa working at the Pulse nightclub in full uniform The officer engaged with the shooter near an entrance Additional officer entered and engaged the suspect in another gunbattle The shooter retreated to the bathroomMina say At that time we were able to save and rescue dozen and dozen of people and get them out of the club Officers then secured everything and the SWAT team wa brought in Mina say officer then set up for an explosive breach on the bathroom wall Mina say he made the decision to breach the wall which created a hole through which dozen of clubgoers were rescued Then the suspect exited through the same hole and engaged in another gunbattle with officer Shooter Omar Mateen wa then killed Why do early report state that police engaged with the suspect prior to the gunman shooting anyone or reportedly calling 911 this appears to directly contradict the main medium narrative ? Additionally by police Chief John Mina s admission a fully uniformed officer wa working at Pulse nightclub While it is not that unusual for police be at or sometimes moonlight at club a security the detail of how and exactly when the shooting occurred remain partially obscured in mainstream medium reportsWhile ISIS medium arm and social medium account reportedly praised the attack there ha been wide scale condemnation of the shooting the world over including the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation who discussed this horrible act but warned of political campaigning and self-serving agenda following the tragic eventsContinuing the article stated the followingSaudi Arabia s Interior Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Mansour al-Turki told The Associated Press in a text message Monday that Mateen first visited Saudi Arabia for 10 day in March 2011 and again a year later in March 2012 for eight day Not since the San Bernardino shooting last December ha the public s perception been so arrested by a media-driven wave of hyperreality following what appears to be another confusing heavily coordinated incident with an uncanny police and emergency responseCrime Scene Questions Multiple Shooters WitnessedThough the Orlando shooting attack wa officially stated to have been carried out around 2am The Daily Mail published Facebook post from people apparently inside the club that contradict the main timeline suggesting the shooting happened much earlierHere are the Facebook comment featured in the Daily Mail for review If these time stamp are correct and the post have not been doctored in any way then these post present a pretty major crack in the official timeline of event at Pulse nightclubHere s the animated YouTube personality Peekay Truth outlining the Daily Mail time discrepancy associated with the Orlando shooting The UK s Independent published an article displaying an eyewitness account that directly contradicts the lone gunman theory pushed by all major medium outlet in the aftermath of the shooting Police did not immediately name the gunman or provide a possible motive for the attack but official have classified the rampage a a domestic terrorism incident Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said Javer Antonetti 53 told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper he wa near the back of the dance club when he heard gunfire There were so many shot at least 40 he said I saw two guy and it wa constant like pow pow pow From a logistical stand point Mateen s ability to carry out the shooting by himself seems to be another questionable aspect to an increasingly troubled caseAnother club eyewitness Jon Alamo heard 20 40 50 shot and then The music stopped While the stress of the incident could account for some difference forensically it s hard to believe Mateen would have been able to have the ability to shoot over hundred people with only 50 some shotsAccording to multiple eyewitness account people inside the club mentioned that there wa possibly a many a four shooter in around the area The witness seen in the image below described the following Then heMateen called someone he knew and he mentioned that he wa the fourth shooter and there were three others The witness also stated that the alleged shooter may have called police or a news agency stating that America should stop their bombing campaign on ISIS Security Background & Alleged AbuseThe 29-year old Mateen an Afghani-American wa located in Port St Lucie Florida about 120 mile outside of Orlando In 2013 Mateen wa placed under a terror watch list for 10 month interviewed two to three time by the FBI 2013-14 and had worked for one of the largest security firm in the US since 2007 G4S Secure Solutions headquartered in Jupiter Florida and formerly part of a CIA-linked government contractor and security firm Wackenhut CorporationG4S a it turn out wa the very first designated and certified Department of Homeland Security DHS contractor and recently secured a $ 234 million dollar contract with the federal cabinet department In addition to apparently providing security solution for 90 percent of US nuclear facility G4S according to border patrol source ha also been tasked with the transportation and release of illegal immigrant inside the interior of the United StatesAt least one of Mateen s role with G4S wa to transport and provide security for prisoner youth in Florida In 2012 G4S congratulated Mateen for five year of service according to a company newsletterZero Hedge reported the following concerning G4S And this is where the Mateen-G4S link emerges a JW reported previously a security company contracted by the US government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix source said The firm is the abovementioned G4S the world s leading security solution group with operation in more than 100 country and 610000 employee G4S ha more than 50000 employee in the US and it domestic headquarters is in Jupiter Florida Mateen remained on staff to guard prisoner despite medium report that he harassed a co-worker and expressed hateful view in the workplace and wa the subject of a federal investigation for terrorism between 2013-14 for some 10 month According to report the FBI dropped the investigation after Mateen admitted to the work place harassment adding that he wa responding to harassment from others over his beliefsMateen is also stated to have previously worked at Martin Correctional Institution from 2006-07 prior to being featured in a short interview a an actor ? in a major Hollywood designer documentary called The Big Fix in 2012 discussing the BP oil spill at Deep Water HorizonHere you can see Mateen at the 36 minute mark taking what appears to be a quasi-albeit scripted activist-type stance even though he work for the world s largest security contractor Clearly Mateen wa acting in this real documentary What is the public to make of Mateen s own acting and film background a it relates to America s largest mass shooting are we again seeing a clear link between Hollywood and militarysecurity service ? Indeed Mateen ha been featured in another documentary from 2013 called Love City Jalalabad a feature supposedly depicting progressive Afghani youth and a quest for social changeAlso According to Times Union The security company that employed the Orlando nightclub gunman say it ha no record of a co-worker s complaint that the shooter wa angry profane and threatened violenceThe company G4S say in a statement Monday that it ha no record of any complaint by Daniel Gilroy against Omar Mateen Mateen died in a gun battle with police after a mass shooting that left 49 people However Gilroy ha maintained that Mateen began harassing him sending a many a 20 or 30 text message a day and more than a dozen phone message Gilroy said his employer G4S did not intervene After Gilroy left G4S according to the security firm Gilroy told company official in June 2015 shortly after he left the firm that his co-worker were good men and woman that put in an honest day s work and genuinely like to work a a team and contribute Further adding to confusion surrounding Mateen s character Mateen s ex-wife Sitora Yusufiy ha publicly stated that she wa abused during their brief marriage Photo

with many of the apparent shooter already known to authorities21WIRE dubbed 2015 The Year of the Daily Shooter a string of unreal shooting event rippled across America many of which took place over the summertime bleeding over into the chill of fallWhile the public wa still trying to comprehend the shocking and questionable Charlie Hebdo Attacks in early January of 2015 thing began heating up in early May when it wa reported that two Islamic gunman allegedly opened fire outside of a cartoon art exhibition and alleged free speech contest featuring provocative image of the Prophet Muhammad in Garland TexasWhile the incident wa quickly labeled a terror attack along with the vague and forensically undefined ISIS inspired tag for dramatic effect report stated that a pair of shooter Elton Simpson shadowed by a paid FBI informant and Nadir Hamid Soofi targeted a bizarre Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest that wa organized by the American Freedom Defense Initiative led by anti-Islamic Israeli lobbyist Pamela GellerIt wa a staged event that clearly echoed the Charlie Hebdo story line with the usual trial by social medium tweet suggesting guilt before all evidence wa inWithin a short period of time following the suspicious event in Garland it wa revealed that Simpson one of the alleged suspect in the Garland shooting had been under the watchful eye of the FBI for nearly a decade and wa in close contact with an undercover informant during that time similarly outlining the intelligence-linked Kouachi Brothers who were implicated in the Charlie Hebdo incidentAnd just a the dust wa settling after high profile shooting in the spring we learned there wa even more Trouble in the Homeland with yet another alleged terror inspired individual named Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez As bizarre and conflicting report emerged regarding a shooting on July 16th at a US Marine Corps strip mall recruitment center and a secure Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga Tennessee the focus of medium coverage gave the false perception that people were shot within the mall area out in the open However only 48 hour later it wa revealed that victim of the shooting event were actually shot and killed inside of a secure Navy Reserve Training facility By then the national medium narrative had already been disseminated and set into the mind of the publicAs we ve said before whether it s the grafting of an overseas terror based story line or the concept of a rogue patriot-like lone wolf persona we see a psychic assault on the mass one that could potentially convince the public into giving up their civil liberty CANDID CAMERA Omar Mateen s father sSeddique Mateen medium presence and CongressionalCIA company ha caused quite a stir concerning the background

enforcement or intelligence agencyHistorically government operator have often made use of low-life criminal and mentally disturbed individual a part of a larger agenda domestically and abroad According to the Globe and Mail Zehaf-Bibeau wa already designated a a high risk traveller by the Canadian government s security service who had also seized his passport Could this be the reason why the shooter had snapped ? Was he being targeted or being pressured into becoming an informant ? Much wa made of Zehaf-Bibeau s recent conversion to Islam especially from the reactionary neoconservative tribe on Fox News while those on the left called for tighter gun restrictionsWe should make note of the formulaic scripting often seen following these kind of event Alleged connection to terror or terror network a with security link Suspect recently radicalized view on religion Sensational medium projection bring in additional storyline for dramatic effect An unknown motive for the crime said to be committed followed quickly by a presumed motive without evidence Politicians law enforcement and medium call the incident a terror attack before all evidence is reviewedTime and time again we ve seen this same choreographed narrative pushed by mass medium and authority only to be exposed at a later dateReaders should refer to the informant game we outlined in 2014 here at 21WIRE which provided historical context about the FBI s confidential informant past a it relates to the Orlando shooting Human Rights Watch explains The 214-page report Illusion of Justice Human Rights Abuses in US Terrorism Prosecutions examines 27 federal terrorism case from initiation of the investigation to sentencing and post-conviction condition of confinement It document the significant human cost of certain counter-terrorism practice such a overly aggressive sting operation and unnecessarily restrictive condition of confinement The list of terror informant and puppet is a long a it is colorful starting with the infamous Underwear Bomber who wa allowed to travel to the US without a passport and wa accompanied by an intelligence agent on his flight from Amsterdam to DetroitWho can forget the FBI s ill-fated 1993 World Trade Center bombing attempt where FBI handler trained the driver and gave them explosive and worst of all stood by and watched a their sting subject went ahead and detonated their concoction underneath the world s tallest building in New York City Incidentally after the 1993 attack the FBI wa said to have tried to lure Emad A Salem played role in 1993 WTC bombing a former Egyptian army officer who wa a prized undercover operative back into a role a a confidential informant with agent suggesting he should go into the Witness Protection Program Graphic UK ColumnOther recent FBI terror stoogeinformant nightmare includeTamerlan Tsarnaev see his informant story here Buford Rogers see his informant story here Jerad Miller see his informant story here Naji Mansour see his informant story here Quazi Mohammad Nafis see his informant story here Mohamed Osman Mohamud see his informant story here Timothy McVeigh see his informant story here Elton Simpson see his informant story hereBut how doe this relate to the Orlando club shooting ?

happened in Orlando said a law enforcement source familiar with Robertson s history of recruiting terrorist and inciting violence Mateen wa enrolled in Robertson s online Fundamental Islamic Knowledge SeminaryRobertson and several associate were rounded up for questioning early Sunday according to law enforcement source a development his attorney refused to confirm or deny Another intriguing part of the Orlando shooter case wa the fact that Orlando s Orange County had been running a number of mass casualty drill in recent yearsFor those unfamiliar these Emergency response drill often take

by Dr James Tracy we see a clear connection between form of social medium and law enforcement when a coordinated an active-shooter event is about to go live Here s an excerpt below Yet there may be much more to the Visionbox Crisis Actors project reverberating through the flurry of alleged shooting incident taking place since the early 2010s For example Visionbox is proficient in using social medium such a Facebook and Twitter to broadcast a catastrophic event to both participant actor and the public at large In addition the theatric entourage is also knowledgeable at crowdsourcing or monitoring how an event is relayed and interpreted through the body politic via Facebook Twitter and so on In December 2012 Visionbox Crisis Actors produced a detailed 73-page syllabus Social Media in Emergency Management an instructional class foregrounding the central role of social medium to coordinate and convey a catastrophic event The YouTube channel Stranger than Fiction News display medium interview with an eyewitness Janiel Gonzales who stated that there wa another person preventing people from leaving Pulse nighclubAdditionally the YouTube video montage another interview with a professional actor and model named Luis Burbano admitting he wa blocking an exit at the time of the shooting Here s another YouTube video from End Times Headline News which raise important question concerning the crime scene The Politics of Mass Shootings Like other mass shooting event there appears to be deliberate attempt to radically manipulate public opinion following each major incident the Orlando shooting is no exception We ve already seen the Orlando shooting attack send political rival Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton into campaign overdriveThis type of subliminal propaganda ha become a doorway for all hot button socio-political issue including gun controlreform and for those concerned over mental illness background check and securityOnce again the medium play a crucial role not in informing and educating the public or even investigating a crime or questioning the state s method and motif in any high-profile eventIn 2015 The Washington Post published an article listing the apparent number of mass shooting in America According to the Mass Shooting Tracker the definition of a mass-shooting event ha been changed to include a larger number of shootingsHowever perhaps the most glaring and obvious grandstanding seemed to occur in Obama s 2015 legacy interview a he expressed his inability to change gun law during the course of his presidency Here is an excerpt from the BBC interview You mentioned the issue of gun that is an area where if you ask me where ha been the one area where I feel that I ve been most frustrated and most stymied it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety law Even in the face of repeated mass killing FRAMING REALITY Mateen s wife Noor Salman and their young child Reports suggest that Disneyland may have also been a target Image Scource foxnewsFamily DesignsUntil recently in medium there wa almost no discussion of Mateen s current wife Noor Salman In 2013 Omar Mateen married Noor Zahi Salman and they reportedly have a 3-year-old son togetherAccording to public record Noor Zahi Salman age 30 ha scrubbed her social medium history Omar Mateen lived in St Lucie County Florida with his second wife Noor Zahi Salman but it is not clear if they were together or separated at the time of the shooting Mateen sold his sister Mariam Seddique the house in April 16 for $ 10 Quit Claim Deed The Telegraph stated that Salman lived in a suburb of Chicago before moving to Fort Pierce with Mateen in November 2012 In December 2015 she is believed to have left Florida and moved in with relative in Rodeo California She ha not spoken publicly and ha scrubbed her social medium account since the attack Early indication suggest the Orlando shooter s back story could shape up like the San Bernardino shooting involving multiple arrest with international background that could shine a light on other clandestine activity linking both terror and securitySan Bernardino along with staged-managed event like the sensational Garland Shooting in April 2015 and the highly engineered Paris Attacks January & November of 2015 and many other shooting in year s past have conveniently opened the door for sweeping national security change while at the same time reigniting the old War on Terror meme rebranded a the War on Radical Islam for new audience to be politically seduced by from western medium and politician alike IDENTITY CRISIS Mateen frequented gay night club according to those who knew him Image Source abcnewsThe UK s Telegraph reported the following The man who murdered 49 people at a gay club in Orlando wa a closet homosexual who used gay dating apps and frequented gay bar according to friend and local in the cityOn Tuesday police were considering pressing charge against Omar Mateen s second wife Nour Salman 30 who told the FBI she went with him to scope out possible target and that she had tried to stop him from carrying out the attack Wouldn t this drastically alter the main narrative of the alleged shooter s hate crime motive ?

Glennon say it s the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people Here are the key question and response from the interviewWhat evidence exists for saying America ha a double government ? GLENNON I wa curious why a president such a Barack Obama would embrace the very same national security and counterterrorism policy that he campaigned eloquently against Why would that president continue those same policy in case after case after case ? Why would policy maker hand over the national-security key to unelected official ? GLENNON It hasn t been a conscious decision Members of Congress are generalist and need to defer to expert within the national security realm a elsewhere They are particularly concerned about being caught out on a limb having made a wrong judgment about national security and tend therefore to defer to expert who tend to exaggerate threat The court similarly tend to defer to the expertise of the network that defines national security policyIsn t this just another way of saying that big bureaucracy are difficult to change ? GLENNON It s much more serious than that These particular bureaucracy don t set truck width or determine railroad freight rate They make nerve-center security decision that in a democracy can be irreversible that can close down the marketplace of idea and can result in some very dire consequencesCouldn t Obama s national-security decision just result from the difference in vantage point between being a campaigner and being the commander-in-chief responsible for 320 million life ? GLENNON There is an element of what you described There is not only one explanation or one cause for the amazing continuity of American national security policy But obviously there is something else going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W Bush administrationThis isn t how we re taught to think of the American political systemGLENNON I think the American people are deluded to believe that the institution that provide the public face actually set American national security policy They believe that when they vote for a president or member of Congress or succeed in bringing a case before the court that policy is going to change Now there are many counter-examples in which these branch do affect policy But the larger picture is still true policy by and large in the national security realm is made by the concealed institutionsDo we have any hope of fixing the problem ? GLENNON The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people And indifference to the threat that is emerging from these concealed institution That is where the energy for reform ha to come from the American people Not from government Government is very much the problem here The people have to take the bull by the horn And that s a very difficult thing to do because the ignorance is in many way rational There is very little profit to be had in learning about and being active about problem that you can t affect policy that you can t changeRead Mark Glennon

close in a bankruptcyChristine Da Silva a Trump Hotels spokeswoman claim that Trump work very hard and spends lot of money to make sure his building are accessible to people with disability It is the policy at all of our property to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act This handful of case many of which are over ten year old are not representative of our organization s strong record of ADA compliance However that handful of case is pretty damning and doesn t support Trump s claimsIn a suit filed in 1997 James Conlon who is paraplegic filed a lawsuit against Trump s Atlantic City Plaza Hotel alleging basic and serious deficiency in accessibility He stayed at the hotel and although he wa placed in a room that wa supposedly accessible the toilet and shower were not usable by someone in a wheelchair As for the public restroom they were so inaccessible he had to ask for help from stranger to be able to use them at all A year later Trump settled the case and agreed to renovate the accessible guest room and public restroom bringing them into compliance with the ADA But a year later Trump admitted to a judge that the renovation had yet to be completedIn 2001 a suit wa brought by Robert Levine and Frieda Zames who are both wheelchair user They alleged that Trump International kept the wheelchair lift locked and when employee finally managed to locate the key they had no idea how to use it Levine said the degrading incident made him feel like a second-class citizen Zames said it wa a if she were a grade school child asking permission to go to the restroom In an attempt to shift the responsibility Trump blamed the architect The case wa amicably settled in 2009 after both side decided to dismiss the caseIn 2003 Conlon filed suit against Trump once again this time alleging the bus between New York and the Atlantic City New Jersey casino wa only accessible to wheelchair user if notice wa given at least a week in advance Naturally Trump sued the bus company and said it wa all their fault but he eventually settled the caseIn 2004 a disabled Purple Heart veteran filed suit against the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York alleging the property wa not equipped with adequately accessible emergency exit guest room and restroom Trump did everything he could to get rid of the suit besides just making his hotel accessible to people with disability that is He attempted to have the case dismissed and dragged it out for three year Just like in 2004 Trump blamed the architect and even launched a countersuit which a judge called bullsh*t on and dismissedHelena Berger the president and CEO of the nonprofit American Association of People with Disabilities said Trump s relentless attempt to squirm his way out of the suit were appalling What wa so striking and frankly appalling wa the way he tried to fight the violation Berger said That I think is really telling The Plaza Hotel became the subject of another complaint in 2007 which the plaintiff eventually agreed to dismiss Yet another lawsuit wa brought against the hotel in 2008 but came to an end when Trump s company declared bankruptcy in 2009In 2011 the Trump Taj Mahal settled

NBC The defense according to Stelter is that terrorist and child molester and serial killer have been interviewed on television It s actually quite sad to hear such vapid analysis from a major broadcasting company like NBC if not surprising Obviously there is a defense between the like of Jones and the rest of the scary cadre of deplorable individual that are mentioned those type of people are almost always automatically viewed a illegitimate by audience It s hard to imagine Jones on the other hand a stacking up to these type of criminal As nutty a Jones is he sound sane if not by much

armed fighting force in addition to seat in parliament and government Saudi-backed effort to weaken the group in Lebanon a decade ago led to Sunni-Shi ite clash and a Hezbollah takeover of Beirut What

Saudi king after his resignation Footage wa aired on Saudi TV He wa then flown to Abu Dhabi to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed the Saudi crown prince s main regional ally He returned to Riyadh

President Donald Trump is considering nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell and Stanford University economist John Taylor for the central bank ’ s top two job in an apparent bid to reassure market and appease conservative hungry for change Under that scenario either Powell or Taylor would take the rein from Fed Chair Janet Yellen when her term expires in early February and the other would fill the vice chair position left vacant when Stanley Fischer retired this month “ That is something that is under consideration but he hasn ’ t ruled out a number of option He ’ ll have an announcement on that soon in the coming day ” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporter on Friday Making Powell a soft-spoken centrist who ha supported Yellen ’ s gradual approach to raising interest rate the next Fed chief would provide the continuity in monetary policy that investor crave The addition of Taylor who ha backed an overhaul of the Fed and embraced a more rigid rule-oriented monetary policy would be a feather in the cap of conservative Republicans who feel that monetary policy ha been too loose under Yellen who wa named a Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and ha led the central bank since February 2014 “ I think Powell might be the safer pick insofar a we know what we ’ re getting ” said Michael Feroli chief US economist at JP Morgan Chase “ He ’ s a guy who obviously know the Fed culture how the policy-setting committee operates so for some of those soft skill we know he would be effective ” Powell ha embraced the Yellen Fed ’ s monetary policy keeping the faith that a tighter job market will eventually push wage higher and end a lengthy period of worryingly low inflation Taylor ha spent the last two decade refining and advocating wider use of a rule that lay out where interest rate ought to be given certain condition of inflation and the broader economy His rule implies that rate should be higher than they are now Yellen speaking at an economic conference in Washington on Friday evening mounted a strong defense of the tool the Fed ha used to fight the sharp economic downturn triggered by the financial crisis and said there wa a risk of another crisis in which those “ unconventional policy ” may be needed again Yellen who Trump ha indicated could still be named to another term a Fed chair wa not asked about the Fed job and did not offer any comment on the selection process Although Taylor is highly regarded within the Fed his rule-based rate-setting position ha spurred criticism that he would handcuff US monetary policy Taylor pushed back at a meeting at the Boston Fed on Saturday saying he favored a flexible implementation of policy rule and did not want to tie the Fed ’ s hand or suggest that he wa motivated by a distrust of policymakers “ I think that ’ s completely incorrect ” he said “ I trust policymakers rule are an effort to make policy better ” Some analyst suggest that fear that Taylor would bring an inflexible monetary policy with him to the Fed a some Republicans in Congress hope are likely exaggerated “ There is some scope for disappointment if people think putting Taylor in will just lead to mechanical-based policy ” Feroli said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaking with reporter on Friday seemed to agree “ Even if you pick a rule the rule itself would need to be modified given the structure of the economy ” she said “ But I do think being systematic looking at the kind of information we look at systematically over time articulating our strategy for policy and being le discretionary is a good idea ” At the same time there are concern that the combination of Powell and Taylor atop the world ’ s most powerful central bank could send a confusing signal to market It is unclear whether Trump who ha criticized Yellen ’ s stewardship but also said on several occasion that he preferred rate to stay low want to dramatically alter the Fed ’ s direction Although he appears to be tilting to Powell and Taylor in addition to Yellen the Republican president ha interviewed his top economic adviser Gary Cohn and former Fed Governor Kevin

reported that crowd size doe matter CNN Fake News reported that President Trump s crowd size wa much smaller than President Obama s crowd size in 2009 and CNN provided two picture to show the differenceHowever the picture in the article show the crowd size for Obama when he wa speaking during his 2009 inauguration with the crowd from Trump s inauguration approximately 3 hour before Trump spokeCNN s report wa another of their Fake News lie The photo used in their post were not comparing apple to apple and President Trump s Press Secretary pointed this out on Saturday in a special press conference Trump s crowd wa huge and every bit a big a Obama s crowd in 2009 Also in CNN s article they say that Obama had 18 million people in 2009 This is now refuted and is more likely closer to 800000The mainstream medium is trying to create a narrative that Donald Trump s inauguration wa a failure by comparing it to Obama s first inauguration and saying that twice a many people showed up to

Counting Guru Stephen Doig ha come forward to offer his insight into the crowd size at both inaugurationsFrom Fast CompanySatellites will by flying over Trump s inauguration a they did in 2009 Journalism professor Stephen Doig one of the guru of crowd counting used an image from satellite company GeoEye to estimate a crowd of 800000 people for Obama s first Inauguration Official estimate for the event though were over twice a high at 18 million which may actually be impossible say researcher DDIS modeled how big a very tightly packed crowd of a million people would stretch back from

Force which support the ceremony When final number come in the 800000 estimated for Trump may also prove wildly optimisticTranslation ? The claim that Obama s first inauguration drew a crowd of 18 million people is fake news at best It also mean that the difference in crowd size is significantly smaller than what the mainstream medium is reporting According to the mainstream medium Obama had over a million more people attend his inauguration than attended Trump s inauguration While Obama s crowd wa bigger the reality is it wa only bigger by a few hundred thousand people it wasn t bigger by over a million peopleComparing Apples To Oranges There are two very important thing to remember when comparing the crowd size # 1 The Weather Was DifferentWhile Barack Obama s first inauguration wa slightly colder than Donald Trump s inauguration by roughly 10 F Obama s inauguration wa bright and sunnyTrump s inauguration wa anything but bright and sunny Trump s inauguration wa cloudy and rainyWeather play a factor when people decide to attend an outdoor event # 2 Violent Liberals Attacked At Trump s InaugurationThis can t be overstated When Barack Obama held his first inauguration protester didn t burn limo s break window at business hit supporter and police didn t have to use percussion grenade All of these thing transpired at Trump s Inauguration by violent and hypocritical liberalsMore than 200 people were arrested for their violent act at the Trump InaugurationWatch here a a young female reporter is trapped in a doorway by anarchist protesting Trump s inauguration This is a perfect example of why Trump supporter were afraid to go to DC for his inaugurationA simple google search for how many people arrested at Obama s first inauguration yielded no arrest number in the first few page Why is that ?

every minute Again Simko had 60 minute to make sure it didn t happen and he did nothing Also individual have the freedom to fly the flag all they want on their private property But this event forced people to salute a flag that had no business flying during our national anthem It wa humiliating Argueta said It wa demeaning because with all the controversy going on with the flag recently and people sitting during the anthem we had all intended to stand but we couldn t People probably looked around probably wondering what we were doing Here s the video via KSTUThe reason why athlete such a

know what he s talking aboutAnd when Fallows say that Donald Trump s ongoing and ever-growing Russia scandal is WORSE than Watergate every American should take noticeThat s exactly what Fallows did in a new article for The Atlantic published on FridayFallows remembers the Watergate scandal clearly despite the fact that it unfolded 45 year agoThe scandal is known a the Watergate scandal because some of President Richard Nixon s goon broke into the Democratic National Committee office at the Watergate hotelNixon tried to cover up the crime by repeatedly lying and refusing to cooperate with investigation He went so far a to fire Archibald Cox the special prosecutor assigned to the investigation Cox wanted Nixon to release White House recording and Nixon refused Nixon wanted Cox to back off but Cox refused Nixon then fired him After that it wa all downhill for Nixon The Supreme Court ordered him to release the tape and they were so damning that Nixon resigned before he could be impeachedBut Trump s Russia scandal is worse Based simply on what is known so far this scandal look worse than Watergate Fallows wrote Worse for and about the president Worse for the overall national interest Worse in what it suggests about the American democratic system s ability to defend itself Fallows point out that Watergate wa a mere burglary in an effort to find information on Nixon s political opponent Trump s scandal on the other hand isNothing le than attack by an authoritarian foreign government on the fundamental of American democracy by interfering with an election and doing so a part of a sustained effort that included parallel interference in the United Kingdom France Germany and elsewhere At worst such effort might actually have changed the election result At least they were meant to destroy trust in democracy Not much of this is fully understood or proven but the potential stake are incomparably greater than what happened during Watergate crime and cover-up alikeFallows then compared Nixon s firing of Cox to Trump s firing of FBI Director James ComeyWhile Nixon paid lip-service to the concept of due process and checks-and-balances and at least acted like he wa sticking to some recognizable rule Trump s ha openly disdained and flouted the rule Nothing Donald Trump ha done on the campaign trail or in office ha expressed awareness of or respect for established rule Fallows continued Nixon s private comment could be vile but nothing he said in public is comparable to Trump s dismissing James Comey a a showboat or the thuggishly menacing tweet that Trump sent out today The tweet Fallows referenced is a clear threat from Trump aimed at Comey in an effort to keep him from speaking to the pressJames Comey better hope that there are no tape of our conversation before he start leaking to the press ! Donald J Trump realDonaldTrump May 12 2017And while Nixon wa a dark and complex person who wa deeply knowledgeable and publicly disciplined and possessed political and strategic intelligence Trump ha repeatedly proven that he is impulsive and ignorant and apparently beyond the reach of any control even his own And what s also worse about Trump s Russia scandal is the way Republicans have circled the wagon around Trump and have made attempt after attempt to bury any investigation into his misconductWhile Republicans like Jason Chaffetz Mitch McConnell and Devin Nunes have all tried to sabotage investigation on Trump s behalf it wa Republicans like Charles Wiggins Barry Goldwater and Howard Baker who put their country before party and sided against NixonThe Republicans who turned against Nixon will be remembered for doing the right thing when their country needed them most Today s Republicans will only be remembered for doing nothing while their country burned to the ground Fallows even point out that all it would take is three brave Republicans in the Senate to join Democrats to get a truly independent investigation rollingThe question is whether they actually care about their country the Constitution and the integrity of the office of the presidency enough to do soOur country need hero now more than ever Republicans could be those hero if they would just stop being coward

according to Silver s measure Clinton s win in heavily diverse state like Texas Nevada Florida South Carolina etc most closely represents the Democratic electorate in the general electionSilver predicts through meticulous exit polling data and election trend that the citizen who cast their vote for the Democratic nominee in November will be 54 percent white 24 percent black 15 percent Latino Hispanic and 7 percent Asian That s a pretty diverse electorate something Democrats should take pride inSilver also say this is why Clinton will most likely be the nominee As Silver writes Clinton s major win in state like Florida and Texas are embody the coalition Democrats need to winIn addition to being important to the Democratic Party s electoral present and future Florida Virginia North Carolina and Texas are quite diverse They re diverse ideologically Miami and Austin aren t exactly the most conservative part of the country and they re diverse racially They contain not only a substantial number of African-Americans but also Hispanics and increasingly Asian-American votersIn fact these state are among the most demographically representative of the diverse Obama coalition that Clinton or Sanders will have to rely on in NovemberThe state whose primary most resemble the real Democrat electorate areOne of Clinton s strength come from the black vote which carried her to an impressive sweep of the SouthSummed upIn other word Clinton ha won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographic strongly resemble those of Democrats a a whole This shouldn t be surprising Clinton is winning nationally by about 14 percentage point in the popular vote So if you re in a state that s well-representative of Democrats national demographic you might expect her

Congressional investigator say they ve uncovered another attempt by the Obama administration to aid illegal immigrant in the US this time by teaching foreign worker lesson on union organizingThe National Labor Relations Board ha entered into agreement with Mexico Ecuador and the Philippines to teach worker from those country in the United States their right when it come to union activityThe agreement reportedly don t distinguish between illegal and legal immigrant But lawmaker are worried it s part of an effort to shield illegal immigrant specifically by encouraging them to join a union and get protectionNLRB spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek explained to Fox News that under the National Labor Relations Act employee whether documented or undocumented are protected from retaliation due to union or other protected concerted activity That mean employer could be charged for dismissing an illegal immigrant worker if the firing is determined to be tied to the worker s union activityHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte a Republican from Virginia argued illegal immigrant worker could soon learn to exploit the system creating a catch-22 for business They could instead be charged with violating the National Labor Relations Act because someone will claim that they re doing it because the individual is engaged in unionization activity Goodlatte saidHe also claimed the Obama administration wa trying to keep the NLRB union education agreement which were originally signed in 2013 and 2014 quiet This is the first we ve learned of this and it s the first that news organization have learned of this and they didn t learn it because the administration came out and told them Goodlatte told Fox News They learned about it because of leaked material and again that is not the kind of transparency the American people expect of their government An NLRB official though disputed the notion that the agreement wa a new development or something that wa intentionally being kept out of the news Yet it isn t just the NLRB that could view union activity a a shield for illegal immigrantsIn June 2011 then-Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued a memo saying ICE officer special agent and attorney are reminded to exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis when making detention and enforcement decision in the case of individual engaging in a protected activity related to civil or other right for example union organizing While this may serve a a way to boost union membership at a time when their number are trending downward one activist said it will likely hurt US citizen union member in the end It seems that the union is almost selling out the interest of American worker and legal immigrant worker in order to boost it

also issued a large number of H-1B challenge – nearly 59000 - from January through August 2016 and a similar number in 2015 Immigration attorney have for year complained about redundant and burdensome challenge to high-skilled employment visa But they say they are seeing a new trend in the Trump era In addition to querying application more often the Trump administration is targeting entry-level job offered to skilled foreigner The lawyer say this violates the law governing H-1Bs because it allows for visa holder to take entry-level job Several attorney said they view the increase in challenge and focus on entry-level job a a stealth campaign by the administration against the H-1B program in the absence of public regulatory change or change passed by Congress which could be debated and decided in the open “ One way to have an immigration policy that ’ s consistent with the policy that ’ s been articulated by the Trump administration is to put more scrutiny on H-1B case ” said Cyrus Mehta a New York-based immigration attorney USCIS spokesman Robert C Langston did not directly address the new trend identified by lawyer or the sharp spike in RFEs this year In an email he said the agency is applying “ currently existing policy that interprets existing statutory and regulatory requirement to evaluate petition ” Partners HealthCare is a healthcare system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital two prestigious teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School It ha received more than 50 RFEs from USCIS so far this year compared to fewer than 15 all of last year in response to a similar number of H-1B petition said Anthony Pawelski an immigration attorney who handle H-1B application for Partners USCIS questioned the hospital ’ connection to the university even though their application included proof of their non-profit status a 1948 agreement between Harvard Medical School and the hospital and even text from the hospital ’ website referencing a 200-year history with the university Pawelski said “ They ’ re doing anything they can to delay the processing and adjudication and in their mind close any perceived loophole ” he said Langston declined to comment on specific H-1B petition It is still unclear how the increase in challenge will affect the number of visa issued this year In the 2016 fiscal year USCIS approved 87 percent of H1-B petition By June 30 of this year the agency had approved 59 percent of H-1B petition although that number is incomplete because it doe not take into account the last three month of the 2017 fiscal year when a large portion of H-1B application are processed Both Democratic and Republican lawmaker have criticized H-1B visa because the biggest beneficiary are outsourcing firm which critic say use the program to fill lower-level information technology job and replace American worker Members of both party have introduced legislation this year to reform the visa ’ s use In an April executive order Trump directed a review of the H1-B program aimed at ensuring the visa “ are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid ” applicant The order itself did not implement change but directed agency to suggest reform “ What the Trump administration ha done for the first time in a very long time is take seriously the fact that company are misusing the H-1B system ” said Russell Harrison director of government relation at IEEE-USA the American branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers The group opposes the H-1B program but support giving more high-skilled foreigner employment-based permanent residence Many of the government challenge for visa for entry-level job either say that the salary should be higher because the job is too complex or that the job doe not count a a “ specialty ” occupation a required by the H-1B program according to a review of hundred of RFEs by the American Immigration Lawyers Association provided to Reuters Entry-level job are position for fresh university graduate with little or no work experience Such job can pay “ Level 1 ” wage the lowest of four tier “ An RFE may be justified if the wage level is not appropriate for the position ” said Langston the USCIS spokesman The USCIS data did not specify what position the RFEs challenged or the reason for the challenge Lawyers question the implicit argument advanced by USCIS in the challenge - that specialty job can not be entry-level They point to young doctor and engineer for instance who may not have work experience but have spent year learning technical skill Though the challenge can come across all industry the AILA review showed software developer and computer system analyst were challenged more often than other job Silicon Valley tech giant either declined to comment or did not respond to request for comment on whether they had been receiving more RFEs The request can increase legal fee associated with each H-1B visa by a much a half attorney said Government fee for H-1B visa can run upwards of $ 2500 and standard fee paid to lawyer per application can easily reach $ 2000 or more The increased cost and hassle could discourage employer from hiring such foreign worker especially at junior level immigration lawyer said Jeffrey Gorsky an attorney with Berry Appelman & Leiden LLP one of the largest corporate immigration firm in the country said one of the firm ’ s client a mid-sized tech company wa hit with six RFEs from USCIS in a single day this year Between late 2015 and the end of 2016 the company

Washington s muscle flexing seems to have taken on a life of it own a the shadow of US neocolonialism fall over much of the world with increasing intensity In Syria the US is lashing out lawlessly at the bastion of resistance that ha been denying it objective for almost seven year Now the US secretary of State Rex Tillerson ha declared that China should exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to step away from it nuclear and missile programme Footage of a reported massive live fire drill conducted by the North Koreans in April 2017 give some indication of what the US might face if this escalation is magnified beyond recall by the usual suspect at Fox News and CNN This report is from Peter Symonds of WSWSIn what amounted to a barely disguised threat US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson yesterday declared that China had to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to abandon it nuclear and missile program if it want to prevent a further escalation in the region In other word if Beijing fails to rein in the Pyongyang regime the US could resort to military measuresTillerson s remark followed a top-level meeting in Washington between him and US Defence Secretary James Mattis and their Chinese counterpart China s foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and General Fang Fenghui chief of the People s Liberation Army s joint staff departmentTillerson called on China to make greater effort to halt illicit revenue stream to North Korea that allegedly help fund Pyongyang s military program Just last week he told a congressional committee the Trump administration wa at a stage where we are going to have to start taking secondary sanction that is penalise country and corporation that engage in economic activity with North KoreaUnilateral secondary sanction imposed by the US would above all fall on Chinese company China is by far North Korea s largest trading partner US official and the medium have repeatedly accused Beijing of failing to do enough to choke off trade and finance with the Pyongyang regime Any penalty against Chinese individual or entity would quickly sour relation between the US and ChinaJust before the talk US President Donald Trump signalled that time wa running out for China to force North Korea to bow to US demand While I greatly appreciate the effort of President Xi Jinping and China he tweeted on Tuesday it ha not worked out While Tillerson s remark indicate the US continues to pressure China for action against North Korea Trump s tweet is a warning that the US will resort to other measure including military action if there are no resultsAsked about Trump s tweet Defence Secretary Mattis told the joint press conference with Tillerson What you re seeing I think is the American people s frustration with a regime that provokes and provokes and provokes and basically play outside the rule play fast and loose with the truth Mattis denounced Pyongyang in particular for the death of Otto Wambier the American student imprisoned in North Korea who died on Monday after being flown back to the US last week The Trump administration is considering a ban to prevent Americans from visiting Pyongyang Three other US citizen are currently jailed in North KoreaThe comment of Mattis and Tillerson suggest that relation with China could deteriorate rapidly especially if North Korea conduct another nuclear test or a long-range missile launch In comment to CNN unnamed US official claimed this week that satellite imagery showed new activity at North Korea s underground nuclear test site and suggested that a sixth nuclear detonation could be imminentAhead of yesterday s talk in Washington US State Department official indicated that Mattis and Tillerson would press their Chinese counterpart not only on North Korea but a range of other sensitive issue including the South China Sea and the so-called war on terrorismActing Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Susan Thornton told Voice of America that all party should freeze any construction or militarisation of feature in the South China Sea a comment directed especially at China Last month the US navy carried out another provocative freedom of navigation operation sending a guided missile destroyer within the 12-nautical-mile territorial limit claimed by China around one of it isletsTrade and economic issue were excluded from yesterday s US-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue but remained just below the surface During last year s presidential election campaign Trump repeatedly denounced China s trade policy and threatened punitive trade war measure In seeking Beijing s assistance to pressure Pyongyang Trump suggested the US could make concession on tradeHaving tweeted that Chinese effort have not worked out the implicit threat is that the US could ramp up the pressure on China over trade What Trump is saying is I don t need you on North Korea now and therefore maybe we should have it out on these other issue like trade analyst John Delury told the New York TimesChina is reluctant to impose new sanction that will cripple North Korea s economy and provoke a political crisis that could be exploited by the US and it ally At yesterday s talk Chinese official reiterated Beijing s call for renewed negotiation based on a freeze by Pyongyang on it nuclear and missile test and a freeze by Washington on it joint military exercise in South Korea The US ha flatly rejected the proposalAbove all the threat of US military strike against North Korea hang over Asia Earlier this week the Pentagon again sent two B-1 strategic bomber on a mission over the Korean Peninsula in a provocative show of force The US Navy ha two aircraft carrier strike group stationed in the area with another on it wayAny US military action against North Korea threatens to trigger an all-out conflict on the Korean Peninsula that could draw in other power including China with devastating consequence

Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSN executive and White House adviser Gary Cohn shocked more than a few of his former Wall Street colleague this week when he showed support for reinstating a Depression-era law that would break up the biggest US bank Here are some detail about the law called the Glass-Steagall Act and why it ha returned to the spotlight WHAT IS GLASS-STEAGALL Originally passed a part of the US Banking Act of 1933 Glass-Steagall established a firewall between commercial and investment banking activity The law wa whittled away over time a bank gained permission to engage in more trading activity and wa repealed altogether in 1999 with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act WHO SUPPORTS IT ? Since the 2008 financial crisis Glass-Steagall ha become a calling card for politician eager to crack down on Wall Street Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren frequently invokes it and Senator Bernie Sanders made it a major part of his presidential campaign President Donald Trump also seized on the policy during his campaign WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY ? The Trump administration ha not backed away from his campaign stance but there are question about how aggressively the president will push for a new law The issue only tends to come up when official are asked about it Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supported a modern version of Glass-Steagall in response to a question during his confirmation hearing White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the White House support the proposal when asked by reporter Cohn responded favorably when asked by Warren at a private meeting with senator WHAT WOULD A NEW GLASS-STEAGALL LOOK LIKE ? There are number of idea to create what some refer to a a “ 21st Century Glass-Steagall ” Warren ha proposed splitting commercial and investment banking and also barring depository institution from using modern financial instrument like derivative Thomas Hoenig the vice chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ha proposed a similar split and would subject bank to a higher 10 percent capital requirement Neel Kashkari president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis would force big bank to take on so much capital they would prefer to split into smaller institution COULD IT HAPPEN ? Although many Wall Street critic have seized on Glass-Steagall effort to change the law have garnered very little support Warren ’ s proposal received just a handful of legislative co-sponsors And because Congress and the White House are still consumed with complex fight over health care and tax reform there seems to be little appetite for a broad controversial overhaul of the financial system ARE THERE RISKS FOR BANKS ? Big US lender including JPMorgan Chase & Co JPMN Bank of America Corp BACN and Citigroup CN would be most impacted because their commercial lending and investment banking operation are closely intertwined say analyst Goldman Sachs Group Inc GSN and Morgan Stanley MSN might be le impacted although they would likely have to revert to being standalone investment bank and shed their deposit funding But even if Glass-Steagall doe not become law the industry may have to spend money time and energy lobbying against the idea when they would rather focus on rolling back existing rule',\n 'Umm Yeah Okay Would it be acceptable to the school if this teacher asked her student to close their eye and pretend to be Jesus ?

Washington ha accused Syria and Russia of war crime in Aleppo According to the report indiscriminate airstrikes across the eastern part of the city by Government force and their ally Russia are responsible for the overwhelming majority of civilian casualty These violation constitute war crime And if knowingly committed a part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against civilian they constitute crime against humanity The UN Human Rights Council ha now voted to start an independent investigation The purpose of the investigation is to indict Russia and Putin a war criminal and to bring to justice those responsible for the alleged abuse Moreover the situation should be urgently referred to the International Criminal Court Every party to this conflict must know that they will be held accountable for the international crime they commit all without selective protection or discrimination Keep in mind that Washington provides the largest share of the UN s budget and the UN will overlook that it wa Washington that sent ISIS to AleppoObviously neither Washington nor the UN will be able to drag Putin into the International Criminal Court but a war criminal charge can serve Washington s purpose by stopping Putin from traveling abroad and curtailing his diplomatic effort The purpose of this orchestrated exercise is it propaganda value Among Washington s many concern is that some Eastern European country alarmed by the conflict that Washington is leading them into with Russia will threaten NATO with a non-participation statement If Russia is branded a war criminal it becomes even more difficult for country that foolishly and thoughtlessly joined NATO to extricate themselves from the consequences2 Washington ha succeeded in bringing to power in Poland the far right-wing Law and Justice Party These agent of Washington have re-opened the matter of the death of Poland s President Kaczynski in a plane crash making wild claim that the crash wa a terror attack by Russia aimed at depriving Poland of it political leadership Despite massive and convincing evidence to the contrary the Law and Justice Party s claim will find traction thanks to the scary portrait of Russia painted by Washington s demonization campaign The intended result is to further blacken and isolate Russia and it government3 As the anointed spokesperson for the neoconservative warmonger Hillary want Washington to enforce a no-fly zone in Syria A no-fly zone would require Washington to attempt to prevent Syrian and Russian air strike against ISIS position It seems clear enough that Syria and Russia would not accept any attempt to deny Syria the use of the country s own airspace in the conflict against force sent by Washington to overthrow the Syrian government a happened to

ha been resurrected Fabricated report are appearing that the Syrian air force is guilty of dropping chemical weapon on the Syrian population On October 22 the Indian Express reported that on October 21 the UN-Led Joint Investigative Mechanism informed the UN Security Council that the chemical attack on Qmenas wa caused by a Syrian Arab Armed Forces helicopter dropping a device from a high altitude which hit the ground and released the toxic substance that affected the population The report concluded that three of the chemical attack investigated were made by Syria and one by the Islamic StateThe fact that the Russians resolved the chemical weapon issue in 2014 a year before the alleged attack on Qmenas by taking possession of the weapon and removing them from Syria mean that the report ha little credibility However at no time during Washington s 15-year-old attack on Muslim country have fact played any role and certainly fact have played no role in Washington s

In 1997 one brave student took on the University of Michigan and their unfair practice of making the race of the student applicant a much higher priority than the accomplishment of the student when making admission decision Meanwhile a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law wa also filed Both Gratz and Grutter s case ended up in the US Supreme CourtHere s what happenedIn 2003 the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Gratz v Bollinger and Grutter v Bollinger Several year after CIR s historic victory in the Fifth Circuit Hopwood v Texas which struck down the use of racial preference in all state in the Fifth Circuit the Sixth Circuit court of Appeals upheld the use of the racial preference program at the University of Michigan Because of the contrary conclusion of law reached by the Circuit Courts the Supreme Court agreed to hear the caseCIR successfully urged the Supreme Court to strike down the racial preference system at the University of Michigan s College of Literature Science and the Arts but the Court left the door open for university to continue using racial preference under narrow circumstance and allowed the University of Michigan s law school to continue it practice of utilizing race-based admissionsJennifer Gratz applied to the University of Michigan s undergraduate College of Literature Arts and Sciences in 1994 when she wa still a high-school senior in a suburb of Detroit In high-school she worked a a math tutor a cheerleader and served a her Class Congress Representative She scored 25 on the ACT in the 83rd percentile and graduated high-school with a 3765 GPA Despite these accomplishment Gratz wa put on a waitlist before ultimately being denied admission to the UniversityAt the time Gratz applied the University analyzed prospective applicant under a grid system Gratz combined ACTGPA score placed her just outside the presumptive admit portion of the grid used to analyze her result However the University had a separate grid for analyzing potential applicant it considered underrepresented minority On this second grid Gratz s score placed her far above the minimum threshold of automatic admissionOn their own merit Gratz s achievement gave her a competitive chance of gaining admission But if the University had considered Gratz a a favored minority applicant she would have had a 100 % chance of gaining acceptance For Gratz race wa the difference between rejection and acceptanceTwo year after Jennifer Gratz wa rejected from the University of Michigan undergraduate program Barbara Grutter applied to the University Of Michigan School Of Law Barbara Grutter had graduated from Michigan State University in 1978 with high honor and a 381 GPA Even though she scored a 161 on the LSAT Grutter postponed a Law School career to start a successful health care information firmIn 1996 at age forty-three Grutter returned to pursue her ambition of attending law school Despite a life-long record of achievement Grutter wa wait-listed and eventually denied admission to the University of Michigan Law SchoolLike the undergraduate admission process the Law School used a grid system to evaluate potential candidate for admission A white female applicant with Barbara Grutter s score had le than a 9 % chance of admission on the grid However under the same system a favored minority applicant with the same score had a 100 % chance of gaining admission As with Gratz Grutter s race wa ultimately the difference between automatic acceptance and automatic rejectionLawsuits FiledIn 1997 CIR filed a lawsuit on behalf of Jennifer Gratz against the University of Michigan s undergraduate admission system and a second lawsuit on behalf of Barbara Grutter against the University of Michigan Law School Combined with CIR s recent victory in Hopwood v Texas these challenge made it substantially more likely that the Supreme Court would take the caseCIR argued that the University violated the Fourteenth Amendment s promise of equal protection by discriminating against Gratz and Grutter Neither institution could profer a compelling justification for the discrimination nor could they argue that the system of racial preference wa narrowly tailored to avoid harming student like Gratz and GrutterIn light of the ongoing lawsuit the University of Michigan change it admission system The undergraduate school abandoned the grid system in favor of a point system Under the new system an application to the school could score a maximum of 150 point The higher the number of point the more likely an applicant would be admittedThe method in which point were allotted made race a decisive factor in the admission process If the University considered an applicant an underrepresented minority the applicant wa awarded an automatic twenty point or one-fifth of the total point needed to guarantee admission The University did not weigh any other factor or consideration a heavily a race The resulting method meant that an applicant with extraordinary artistic talent could only be awarded a maximum of five point for his talent while another applicant could receive twenty point by virtue of belonging to a certain racial groupThis mechanical method of assigning point based on outward characteristic alone is a prime example of what Shelby Steele called the disappearance of the black individual In his classic essay for Harper s magazine Steele lamented that institution like the University of Michigan failed to treat African Americans a individual with real accomplishment These institution Steel argued cared more for their own image than they did for helping individual African-AmericansDistrict Court VictoriesCIR s two case were heard by different judge in the District Court In Gratz Judge Duggan ruled that the grid system under which Jennifer Gratz had been rejected wa unconstitutional but that the point system in place since then wa a justified mean of attaining a diverse student bodyIn Grutter Judge Bernard Friedman issued a more direct and clear cut victory for CIR and Barbara Grutter Judge Friedman held in accordance with Hopwood v Texas that diversity is not a compelling government justification for discrimination The court accordingly struck down the Law School s race-based admission systemThe University of Michigan appealed both case and a divided en banc panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Grutter s victory at the district court and held that the University wa justified in using racial preference to achieve diversity The Sixth Circuit never issued a ruling in GratzThe Supreme CourtAfter the Sixth Circuit loss in Grutter CIR petitioned the Supreme Court asking them to hear both case a they presented an urgent question of constitutional law The Court agreed and handed down decision in June of 2003Chief Justice Rehnquist writing for the Court in Gratz struck down the University of Michigan s undergraduate admission system Justice Rehnquist reasoned that the point system assigning point based on outward characteristic treated applicant in a manner that prized their race over their individual accomplishment The failure of the University to treat applicant a individual constituted a violation of the Fourteenth AmendmentIn Grutter however Justice Sandra Day O Connor upheld the Law School admission system and reasoned that fostering diversity in higher education is a compelling government interest Justice O Connor argued that a distinction could be made between the mechanical racial preference used in the undergraduate system and the racial preference employed by the law school Essentially doing away with the strict scrutiny analysis that racial classification require Justice O Connor deferred to the law school to determine whether racial preference are necessary The Court did however limit the legality of racial preference to a period of twenty-five year when the government will no longer have a a compelling justification to foster diversityJustice Clarence Thomas who dissented from the ruling agreed that racial preference would be unconstitutional in twenty-five year However he also argued that what is unconstitutional twenty-five year from now is also unconstitutional today Either the Constitution forbids the use of racial discrimination or it doe notWhile the combined case of Gratz and Grutter failed to end the government s use of racial preference it achieved the minor victory of placing limit on when and how the government may use such preferencesGratz and Grutter are not the end of the story CIR s client Jennifer Gratz wa later able to end racial preference at the University of Michigan by leading the effort to pas an amendment to the Michigan constitution that banned the use of racial preference When an activist group challenged the constitutionality of the amendment CIR once again came to the aid of Jennifer Gratz In Schuette v Bamn CIR successfully defended the amendment before the Supreme Court Read more about that case hereFurthermore almost twelve year after the Supreme Court decided Gratz and Grutter the issue is once again back before the Supreme Court in the case Fisher v University of Texas CIR ha filed two amicus brief before the Supreme Court in that case that urge the Supreme Court to apply the strict scrutiny that Justice O Connor failed to apply in Grutter In an initial opinion Justice Kennedy agreed with CIR and ruled that even after Grutter court may not punt on applying rigid constitutional analysis After being remanded to the Fifth Circuit that case is once again before the Supreme Court Read more about CIR s ongoing effort to challenge racial preference in

Christian School out of Jacksonville are playing in the District 2-A high school football championship today and coach from both team submitted a request to ensure a 30-second prayer over the

FHSAA host and coordinator of the event is legally a State Actor we can not legally permit or grant permission for such an activity Cambridge head of school Tim Euler doesn t agree with Dearing s ruling We ve played 13 football game this year he told Bay News 9 We ve prayed before every one of them Here s the problem Euler told WTSP The Florida Legislature is opened up with prayer in a

If they can pray there we can pray here and I want them to be able to pray there and I want u to be able to pray here he added So I think Dearing s reasoning is flawed at the core of it Euler said Friday morning hour before the game s 1 pm start time that it s unlikely the team would be able to reverse the decision but belief it s important to highlight the problem nonetheless What we really want to do is raise awareness he told Bay News 9 All we re asking for is an opportunity for two Christian school to pray WTSP attempted to contact the Florida High School Athletic Association about the ruling but the agency ignored it requestWTSP reporter Mike Deeson posted about the controversy on Facebook I wa disappointed the Florida High School Athletic Association didn t return our call he wrote I wanted to know how the legislature open with a prayer in a taxpayer owned building with state employee yet FHSAA maintains a prayer couldn t be said in a taxpayer funding facility the Citrus Bow that wa sanctioned by state employee member of FHSAA Something doesn t make sense when you compare the two but they NEVER returned our call Deeson posted In my opinion that wa a BAD PR MOVE !

damaging it relationship with the White House a she considered how to publicly announce her position on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline according to email published this week by WikiLeaks Clinton aide weighed having the Democratic candidate say she opposed the pipeline in a closed-door union meeting leaking it to news medium outlet or including it without fanfare in a policy fact sheet the email show Clinton eventually announced that she opposed the pipeline on Sept 22 2015 at a town hall event in Des Moines Iowa early in the contest to win the Democratic presidential nomination President Barack Obama also a Democrat announced that he too opposed the project on Nov 6 2015 The WikiLeaks group released it latest batch of apparently hacked personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta on Wednesday just week before the Nov 8 presidential election in which Clinton is facing Republican Donald Trump Whether Clinton would oppose TransCanada Corp ’ s pipeline to bring Canadian crude tar sand oil to refinery on the Gulf of Mexico wa a major issue in her Democratic primary race against chief rival US Senator Bernie Sanders who opposed the project Clinton wa walking a fine line on supporting or opposing the pipeline The Keystone XL controversy put at odds labor union which thought the project would spur job creation and environmentalist who advocated moving away from tar sands-derived oil to cleaner form of energy Clinton ’ s decision wa further complicated by the fact that the pipeline approval process began when she wa Obama ’ s secretary of state from 2009-2013 She said repeatedly that she would wait to announce her position until after the State Department had repeated it review of the project in deference to her former bos Privately aide were figuring out the best way to announce her opposition to the project “ We are trying to find a good way to leak her opposition to the pipeline without her having to actually say it and give up her principled stand about not second-guessing the President in public ” speechwriter Dan Schwerin wrote on Aug 7 2015 in one of the apparently hacked email Schwerin wa responding to a suggestion by Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook that they could use the Keystone announcement to draw news medium attention away from Clinton ’ s use of a private email system while she headed the State Department The Clinton campaign ha declined to verify the authenticity of the Podesta email released by WikiLeaks Podesta told reporter on Tuesday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had notified him it wa investigating the “ criminal ” hack of his email a part of a broader probe The White House last week formally accused Russia of hacking Democratic Party organization in an effort to influence the presidential election a charge Russia ha denied As a result Clinton campaign official and supporter have warned that such email release could include fraudulent or misleading document among genuine email There wa no evidence to indicate that the Keystone email - which provided insight into the campaign ’ s struggle to announce Clinton ’ s position on a major Democratic issue that could put her at odds with the White House - were not genuine Clinton ’ s campaign considered having the former secretary of state address the Keystone issue in a private meeting with a building trade union then immediately roll out a fact sheet on her infrastructure proposal and publish an opinion article on the topic the leaked email show But Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon thought it might be easier to forgo including Keystone in the policy rollout skip the opinion piece and have Clinton state her opposition in the union meeting “ I think we could seem consistent with our past statement about not wanting to get ahead of POTUS on Keystone if her position merely leaked out of the meeting ” Fallon wrote in a Sept 8 2015 email using an acronym for the president “ That would seem like a private comment that she didn ’ t intend to become public ” “ Perhaps we could just issue an infrastructure fact sheet ” without mention of Keystone “ and rely on the Clinton Keystone position to leak either organically or with an assist from u ” Fallon added After Clinton warned at a New Hampshire campaign event on Sept 17 2015 that she could not “ wait too much longer ” and wa “ putting the White House on notice ” that she would soon tell voter her position Podesta checked in with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough “ Trying to calibrate whether we are threading the needle ok with you guy after Valerie getting her nose out of joint on Keystone ” Podesta wrote in a Sept 20 2015 email in an apparent reference to Valerie Jarrett a senior adviser to Obama Podesta said that Clinton ’ s

Yeah That ll work You watch It ll be great We ll have the best market Companies will become safer and more environmentally conscious because of competitionOr so the free-market capitalist wet dream sayMoore really hope that Trump will climb on board with all of this After all Moore just want to help his candidate make America great again and clearly this will do it It s foolproof !

ha so far failed to win the backing of any of the other eight party Should he lose such a vote Babis would stay in power until a new arrangement is found But given his party s size it would also most likely have to lead any other arrangement In a televised ceremony on Wednesday President Milos Zeman appointed Babis 63 who set up ANO in 2011 a a protest movement when mainstream party were embroiled

commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars joined the chorus of condemnation reflecting the highly regarded place the military and it veteran hold with many in the United States Trump ’ s dispute with the Khans ha dominated the White House campaign in recent day and underlined the uneasy alliance between many leading Republicans and the party ’ s freewheeling unorthodox nominee for the Nov 8

killed by a bomb in Iraq 12 year ago Hope Hicks a spokeswoman for Trump said that the campaign wa grateful to have support in Congress and that Republicans are working to keep Democratic nominee

identified said Republican senator were pleased with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ’ s statement on Sunday calling Captain Khan “ an American hero ” and noting “ a travel ban on all member of a religion is simply contrary to American value ” At the same time the aide said the controversy would probably not cause Republican senator to withdraw their endorsement of Trump In a convention

brain-drain of hacker and cyber spy due to a tumultuous reorganization and worry about the acrimonious relationship between the intelligence community and President Donald Trump according to current and former NSA official and cybersecurity industry source Half-a-dozen cybersecurity executive told Reuters they had witnessed a marked increase in the number of US intelligence officer and government contractor seeking employment in the private sector since Trump took office on Jan 20 One of the executive who would speak only on condition of anonymity said he wa stunned by the caliber of the would-be recruit They are coming from a variety of government intelligence and law enforcement agency multiple executive said and their interest stem in part from concern about the direction of US intelligence agency under Trump Retaining and recruiting talented technical personnel ha become a top national security priority in recent year a Russia China Iran and other nation state and criminal group have sharpened their cyber offensive ability NSA and other intelligence agency have long struggled to deter some of their best employee from leaving for higher-paying job in Silicon Valley and elsewhere The problem is especially acute at NSA current and former official said due to a reorganization known a NSA21 that began last year and aim to merge the agency ’ s electronic eavesdropping and domestic cyber-security operation The two-year overhaul includes expanding part of NSA that deal with business management and human resource and putting them on par with research and engineering The aim is to “ ensure that we ’ re using all of our resource to maximum effect to accomplish our mission ” NSA Director Mike Rogers said The change include new management structure that have left some career employee uncertain about their mission and prospect Former employee say the reorganization ha failed to address widespread concern that the agency is falling behind in exploiting private-sector technological breakthrough A former top NSA official said he had been told by three current official that budget problem meant there wa too little money for promotion That is especially important for younger employee who sometimes need two job to make end meet in the expensive Washington DC area the official said “ Morale is a low a I ’ ve ever seen it ” said another former senior NSA official who maintains close contact with current employee Asked about the risk of losing talent from NSA and other agency White House spokesman Michael Anton said Trump had sought to reassure the intelligence community by visiting the CIA headquarters on his first full day in office Anton also pointed to the military spending increase in Trump ’ s budget proposal released on Monday It will likely take more than a visit to the CIA to patch up relation with the intelligence community the current and former official said Trump ha attacked finding from intelligence agency that Russia hacked email belonging to Democratic Party operative during the 2016 presidential campaign to help him win though he did eventually accept the finding In January Trump accused intelligence agency of leaking false information and said it wa reminiscent of tactic used in Nazi Germany The breadth of any exodus from the NSA and other intelligence agency is difficult to quantify The NSA ha “ seen a steady rise ” in the attrition rate among it roughly 36000 employee since 2009 and it now sits at a “ little le than six percent ” according to an NSA spokesman NSA director Michael Rogers said last year that the attrition rate wa 33 percent in 2015 suggesting a sharp jump in departure since then Several senior NSA official who have left or plan to leave including deputy director Richard Ledgett and the head of cyber defense Curtis Dukes have said their departure were unrelated to Trump or the reorganization Some turnover is normal with any new administration government and industry official noted and a stronger economy ha also improved pay and prospect in the private sector “ During this time the economy ha been recovering from the recession unemployment rate have been falling and the demand for highly skilled technical talent ha been increasing ” an NSA spokesman said when asked to comment on the report of employee departure In a statement Kathy Hutson NSA ’ s chief of human resource said the agency continues “ to attract amazing talent necessary to conduct the security mission the nation need ” Some NSA veteran attribute the morale issue and staff departure to the leadership style of Rogers who took over the spy agency in 2014 with the task of dousing an international furor caused by leak from former contractor Edward Snowden Concern about Rogers reached an apex last October when former Defense Secretary Ash Carter and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recommended to then-President Barack Obama that Rogers be removed The NSA did not respond to a request for comment on the recommendation last fall that Rogers be replaced Rogers is now expected to retain his job at NSA for at least another year according to former official Rogers acknowledged concern about potential morale problem last month telling a congressional committee that Trump ’ s broadside against the intelligence community could create “ a situation where our workforce decides to walk ” Trump ’ s criticism of the intelligence community ha exacerbated the stress caused by the reorganization at the NSA said Susan Hennessey a former NSA lawyer now with Brookings Institution The “ tone coming from the White House make an already difficult situation worse by eroding the sense of common purpose and service ” she said A wave of departure of career personnel Hennessey added “ would represent an incalculable loss to national security ”',\n 'ATLANTANEW YORK Reuters - Martin Luther King ’ s daughter said on Monday that “ God can triumph over Trump

Day and all of the many wonderful thing that he stood for Honor him for being the great man that he wa ! ” Trump tweeted Trump and King III emerged from an elevator together shaking hand Trump said goodbye to King then returned to the elevator without answering question King said they had a constructive meeting to discus how to improve the US voting system which King considers broken but he skirted question about whether he wa offended by Trump ’ s comment on Lewis “ First of all I think that in the heat of emotion a lot of thing get said on both side I think at some point I bridge-build The goal is to bring America together ” King told reporter Lewis did not mention Trump in a speech in Miami about the civil right struggle to honor King who would have turned 88 on Sunday but he urged young black Americans to consider voting a “ sacred ” act “ We all must become participant in the democratic process When you get old enough to register to vote go and register and vote ” Lewis said in a half-hour address Gunfire during Miami holiday festivity wounded eight people age 11 to 30 at Martin Luther King Jr Memorial Park police said Two people were detained and two weapon seized and the cause of the shooting is under investigation The Trump-Lewis exchange began when Lewis told NBC News in segment of an interview released on Friday that he would not attend Trump ’ s inauguration in part because “ I don ’ t see this president-elect a a legitimate president ” He referred to the finding of US intelligence agency that Russia used hacking and other method to try to help Trump a Republican defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov 8 election Trump wa withering in his response the following day saying in tweet that Lewis a revered figure who risked his life for civil right wa “ All talk talk talk - no action or result ” While many Democrats and Republicans said they disagreed with Lewis they also questioned Trump ’ s decision to denigrate an African-American political

million to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority BARDA to work on Zika vaccine Burwell said the funding wa intended to keep Zika vaccine research going despite the lack of funding

outbreak began last year in Brazil On Thursday Governor Rick Scott said state health official have identified three additional people in the affected area with locally transmitted Zika bringing the total to 25 The Obama administration in February requested $ 19 billion to fight Zika but congressional lawmaker have been considering a much smaller sum A bill providing $ 11 billion wa blocked by Democrats after Republicans attached language to stop abortion-provider Planned Parenthood from using that government funding for healthcare service mainly in US territory like Puerto Rico The Republican legislation also would siphon off unused money under President Barack Obama ’ s signature 2010 healthcare law to combat Zika In addition Democrats balked at a Republican provision that they

from “ He will probably do it on a prorated basis across the Institutes ” he said Fauci said the budget transfer will not fill the longer-term NIH funding need to fight the virus and to develop a second or third potential vaccine candidate Drugs frequently fail to realize the promise they show in early trial “ We still need about $ 196 million more ” he said Fauci said the health secretary ’ s action wa essentially one of desperation given the failure of Congress to authorize additional funding Taking money from other research program “ is extremely damaging to the biomedical research enterprise ” he said “ We ’ re taking money away from cancer diabetes all those thing ” Dr LaMar Hasbrouck executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials said at

The updated timeline is a major shift in the official story a it raise question about why law enforcement took so long to respond to the shooter s hotel room Furthermore it expose the Mandalay Bay security guard s heroic back story which suggested he stopped the shooter from continuing his shooting massacre In the early day of this investigation this part of the story wa gleefully parroted by mainstream mediaAccording to authority the Mandalay Bay hotel security guard Jesus Campos wa alone and unarmed when he discovered the purported shooter facing some 200 round in the process somehow surviving the massive gunfire with a minor leg injury Based on the amount reported gunfire the public would have likely seen heavy damage inside the hotel hallway and outside the suite in at least several area of the 32nd floor not to mention there would also be additional witness within earshot of the shooting This is something that would have resulted in multiple 911 call to policeThe new report concerning Campos and the shooting timeline now put Las Vegas official in the hot seat a they now have no known reason why the alleged shooter would have stopped his rampageNot only do these new detail challenge police response time but the very nature of how the shooting started a stark contrast to police and FBI press conference detail from the beginning of this investigation Another major aspect is the 6 minute time frame Mandalay Bay recognized a shooting occurring inside their hotel prior to the concert mass shooting Speculation and confusion ha enveloped the Campos story a mainstream report now state there s an armed private security guard outside of the Mandalay Bay security guard s home following the Las Vegas shootingInterestingly the Mandalay Bay security guard who wa previously hailed a a hero remains completely absent from any TV interviews*Update* New report state that Campos who wa scheduled for at least five TV interview abruptly disappeared prior to those appearance One such interview included a FOX News interview with Sean Hannity This new twist in the Las Vegas shooting add another bizarre aspect to an already strange case Here s FOX News below The Mandalay Bay security guard shot by Stephen Paddock in the moment leading up to the worst mass shooting in modern US history wa set to break his silence Thursday night with five television interview including one on Fox News Campos union president saidExcept when the camera were about to roll and medium gathered in the building to talk to him Campos reportedly bolted and a of early Friday morning it wasn t immediately clear where he wa We were in a room and we came out and he wa gone Campos union president told reporter according to ABC News Stephanie Wash QUESTION What s the real story behind the main eye-witness in this case ? *Update* Independent reportage by former Project Veritas operative Laura Loomer suggests that the Campos family may have had a gag order placed on them concerning detail related to the Las Vegas shooting case However official confirmation of this aspect of the case is still pendingThis follows yet another major shift in the Las Vegas shooting timelineAmazingly police have once again revised timeline detail associated with Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos and the alleged shooter now stating that the guard s encounter with the suspected gunman started near the same time a the concert mass shooting A noticeably agitated Las Vegas sheriff Joseph Lombardo now claim that the 959 time frame is when Campos supposedly investigated a nearby door alarm on the 32nd floor a previously reportedInterestingly according to a published article at the LA Times this week a Mandalay Bay spokeswoman appeared to challenge element of this latest Las Vegas shooting timeline but did not elaborate A spokeswoman for the company that owns Mandalay Bay seemed to dispute the police timeline given to The Times on Tuesday but did not explain whyThis remains an ongoing investigation with a lot of moving part As evidenced by law enforcement briefing over the past week many fact are still unverified and continue to change a event are under review MGM Resorts International spokeswoman Debra DeShong said in a statement We can not be certain about the most recent timeline that ha been communicated publicly and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurateDeShong added It is not appropriate for u to comment further at this time on what remains an open matter for law enforcement Here s a look at Las Vegas sheriff Joseph Lombardo giving an emotive and evasive press conference on October 9th a FBI agent Aaron Rouse loom in the background Days ago after several online theory emerged suggesting the possibility that multiple shooter were involved in the Las Vegas shooting Lombardo entertained the idea that Paddock may not have been alone in the hotel suite Since then he s updated this theory after the October 9th press conference stating that there wa no second shooter This follows a week of shifting narrative red herring and misinformation a it now stated police do not believe anyone else entered Paddock s hotel suiteIn spite of the new change to the timeline Clark County Assistant Sheriff Tom Roberts maintains that the hotel dispatched it own armed security team to the 32nd floor which arrived right around the same time a Las Vegas police who official have said arrived on the floor at 1017 pm But the gunman had already fired his final shot out his hotel window at 1015 pm It s important to note at 1012pm or 1013 pm an officer on the 31st floor reported hearing fully automatic gunfire one floor above himBy 1024 pm authority located Paddock s hotel suite with SWAT and remained outside the suspected gunman s room Interestingly at 1028 pm report state there may have been a second gunman on the 29th floor but this wa later believed to be an erroneous account according law enforcementAt 1120 pm police explode the suspected gunman s door locating a body on the floor supposedly dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the headBased on Roberts claim above there would have been a full 56 minute before the hotel suite breach wa said to taken placeQUESTION Will there be additional revision in the official timeline to come a this story continues to go sideways ? Here s a screen shot of the first official timeline of the shooting in the first 24-48 hour after the incident You have to wonder why the story ha been altered so dramatically since then Today reported the following updated information concerning the Las Vegas shooting Watch a Today interview a second eye-witness in the case Stephen Schuck wa one of the first people to encounter Paddock when he went to check out a faulty fire exit door on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay and Casino on Oct 1 according to a new timeline of event I wa about a third of the way down the hallway and I started to hear shot go off he told TODAY in an exclusive interview WednesdaySchuck then saw hotel security guard Jesus Campos stick out his head from a doorwayHe yelled at me to take cover and a soon a I started to go to a door to my left the round started coming down the hallway Shuck said I could feel them pas right behind my head Something hit me in the back and I took cover I tried to think how I could get to Jesus because I could that see he wa shot in the leg and I just told myself wait for him he s going to have to stop shooting some time It wa kind of relentless According to report Schuck calmly called police over his radio following the apparent start of the mass shootingHere s Today s Matt Lauer interviewing the second hotel eye-witness Mandalay Bay hotel maintenance man Stephen Schuck As a barrage of medium speculation continues in any high-profile case a series of formulaic polarizing political point become an echo chamber in it tragic aftermath This is something that rapidly descends into wild speculation which only serf to magnify any emotionally driven aspect that might later be presented a a definitive motive to carry out a crime Very often we ve seen the discovery of a seemingly ready-made manifesto laundry list of hateful rhetoric or collected material from an alleged killer retained a ironclad proof of a crime However current analysis of the alleged Mandalay Bay shooter ha failed to yield any such result in spite of a chorus of overzealous and misinformed reportage from both mainstream medium and alternative medium there ha not been any concrete material linked to Paddock thus farIt should be mentioned that there have been a bevy of accusation suggesting various political and terror affiliation from certain alternative medium circle a mainstream medium continues to float the idea that Paddock may have been radicalized due to evidence revealing a series of cruise taken to the Middle East in recent year by the alleged Las Vegas shooter But so far these claim remain unconfirmed by authoritiesTime will tell if this line of conjecture is perhaps a red-herring meant to corral and ensnare the public by way of an overtly politicized emotional appealIn case such a the Las Vegas shooting one should be careful to not jump to any conclusion a we ve reached the slow drip phase by which information is being conveyed by authority and medium While law enforcement look to tie up loose end and shore up any early hole or bizarre theory it possible that a more thorough analysis of all the forensic data in the case will be pushed into the background a new information may be introduced to steer critic of the official storyIt is ironic that the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting one of the largest mass shooting in the history of America ha been an eerie absence of conclusive evidence concerning a number of detailsBelow is an inside look at the reported hotel suite that appears oddly intact considering the massive amount of gunfire said to have taken place inside on the 32nd floor area Adding to that there wa a delayed release concerning a mysterious document left on a table near the alleged killer s body that contained only number and no letter this wa something that introduced a cryptic backdrop into the compelling crime scene The suspicious nature of the document then became a psychic driver to increase speculation while introducing another unexplained element from the crime sceneThe whole circumstance took on a theatricality that could push the viewer out of a critical investigative mode and into a partially synthetic frame of thinking regarding the murky content of the alleged communiqu Over this past week report suggested that the document at the scene may have contained calculation used by the shooter for maximum firearm accuracy On the surface this would appear to lend itself to the official story but in reality all it doe is lead to more question a contradictory claim over exactly how the dramatic shooting occurred would also seem to contradict analysis of ballistics a the amount of victim wounded or killed would most likely have been far more significant if the shooting wa based on sniper-like calculation that may have made use of hundred to thousand of either 223 or 308 caliber round not to mention the possibility of a belt-fed machine gun scenario using other caliber roundsIn recent year 21WIRE ha documented that frequently there is much more involved behind-the-scenes when it come to high-profile attack in America particularly of those said to be lone wolf variety The incident themselves are quickly taken out of the forensic realm despite early police reportage eye-witness testimony or statistic improbability In this way the narrative give way to a hyper-realized account that defies logic and reasonOther recent report reveal that the well-known casino mogul Steve Wynn self serving or not ha shed light on the particular protocol carried out by casino employee Below is a passage from the NY Post on this aspect of the story Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn suggested Sunday that Stephen Paddock would have set off alarm bell at his property had he tried launching his mass murder from one of themWynn after whom the glitzy Wynn Las Vegas on the Strip is named said his housekeeping staff is trained to do a visual inspection any time they enter a room adding that a Do Not Disturb sign on a door for longer than 12 hour is investigated The scenario that we re aware of would have indicated that Paddock didn t let anyone in the room for two or three day Wynn told Fox News Sunday That would have triggered a whole bunch of alarm here Below is the scanner audio shortly after the crime wa reported to police Moreover many conspiratorial claim that have yet to still be fully explained or even be appropriately addressed by authority have exploded on the internet This ha led to a growing speculation that ha only deepened the mystery behind this America s latest mass tragedy As authority have yet to uncover a clear motive for the crime police scanner audio along with eye-witness testimony ha suggested that multiple shooter may have been at the sceneThe amount of independent examination regarding this case thus far is fairly staggering and in the wake of any multilayered event one must proceed with caution when reviewing the available evidence a the doorway for a trial by medium frenzy in both mainstream medium and alternative medium could be used to derail sincere analysisAlthough the scanner audio is chaotic the police dispatch communication appears to reveal some startling information contradicting the official story surrounding the Las Vegas mass shooting While any event contains it share of confusion the specific acknowledgement of an apparent active shooter or shooter within the fairground of the concert venue point to a deeper more complex methodology used to carry out the attack Rather intriguingly the scandal plagued NY Times published section of these scanner recording for public inspection which could be an attempt by mainstream medium to diminish or control any information regarding potential multiple shootersIn spite of ongoing medium meddling there s been some compelling account suggesting that there may have been gunfire from multiple location by law enforcement and citizen alike While

WORLD TRAVELER -Paddock on an overseas trip believed to be the Philippines in April of 2013 Image Source ghananewsAs the medium stylized profile of Paddock and those around him ha grown the FBI police and medium diverted the public s attention to Danley Paddock s girlfriend a former casino hostess who wa supposedly out of the country in the Philippines at the time of the Mandalay Bay shooting Danley s trip wa paid for by Paddock who is stated to have also wired $ 127000 to her family reportedly to buy a homeAdding to the concern of wired fund intense scrutiny surrounded a suspicious claim that a mysterious woman allegedly gave a dire warning to concert goer some 45 minute before the last night of the Route 91 Festival The overlapping narrative were said not to be related according to police nevertheless the two different aspect were conflated prompting Danley to be named a person of interest who wa then flown back to the US for additional FBI questioning Interestingly some critic have questioned the validity of the warning prior to the concert due to the nature of the televised interviewThe search for Danley s whereabouts prior to the Las Vegas shooting spanned some seven country dating back to mid September and according to neighbor she hadn t been seen since AugustHere s a passage from CNN that revealed the following detail Danley 62 who travel on an Australian passport arrived in the Philippines from Tokyo on September 15 then left for Hong Kong on September 22 and flew back to the Philippines on September 25 said Maria Antoinette Mangrobang a spokeswoman for the Philippine Bureau of Immigration The confusing dynamic prompted Danley and her attorney to later issue a statement claiming she had no prior knowledge of the mass shootingOn October 10th CBS news reported the following CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton report authority were continuing to comb through Paddock s electronic device including a laptop and cellphone at the FBI crime lab in Quantico Virginia So far none of the device point to a motive for the shooting rampage This added to new detail suggesting Paddock s vague use of a freight elevator something according top casino owner Steve Wynn wouldn t have happened at his propertyHere s a second interview with Eric Paddock the alleged shooter s brother who creates his own theory a to how Paddock may have gotten weapon up to the Mandalay Bay suite Watch and listen to his baffling interview with medium Other background information revealed that Patrick Benjamin Paddock left photo Paddock s father wa apparently arrested in 1961 for robbing a Valley National Bank in Phoenix in 1960 something which later landed the elder Paddock on the FBI s most wanted list after escaping a 20-year prison term at Federal Correctional Institution at La Tuna Texas In 1978 Patrick Paddock wa arrested in Oregon where he wa running a bingo parlor under assumed identity Bruce Werner EricksenThe crystallization of Paddock s surreal and hard to believe ancestral lineage creates a criminal hall of mirror all the way from the mind bending counter-culture of the 1960 s to today s Las Vegas mass shootingVery often with hyper-real crime there s a stark portrait that emerges regarding any suspected killer and in the case of Paddock this wa no exception The man named a the Mandalay Bay shooter had no previous criminal record and wa described a a quiet generous man by family member and one alleged neighbor a other medium report painted the apparent killer a someone who may have had trouble controlling his behavior even suggesting he may have had an abusive personality in the pastHowever what seems to be missing in most of these case is a more balanced psychological profile of these solo actor a there is usually an incomplete picture that make little to no sense at all after only a handful of people who knew the purported murderer speak with medium Furthermore you have to wonder why year of business associate and more acquaintance and friend have not come forward with any additional informationAdditionally there have other suspicious sidebar concerning the Las Vegas shooting One such story wa posted on the

official announced they were investigating a recent 4chan exchange that appeared to predict the rampage In a cryptic post on the r9k board on Wednesday an anonymous poster with an image of Pepe the Frog holding a gun reportedly posted Some of you guy are alright Don t go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning so long space robot 4chan ha been rife with controversy since it inception a some critic think it may indeed be a limited hangout for the intelligence community And due to the suspect nature of the website a bevy of internet researcher have questioned the highly orchestrated law enforcement response in the aftermath of the UCC shooting via the apparent 4chan warningA more recent 4chan post seemed to propel additional misinformation regarding nature of the shootingDuring this same time SITE Intelligence injected an ISIS meme into this event without revealing any solid evidence This then prompted an apparent official statement that echoed those dubious claim from ISIS So far these claim linger though they ve failed to produce any connection to ISISAs we ve noted numerous time here at 21WIRE the intelligence monitoring group called SITE ha tie to both the CIA and Israeli intelligence The group ha also had ethical concern raised over the nature of their intel gathering in the last decade and according to the group s founder Rita Katz they ve managed to release terror related material linked to ISIS prior to the group itselfKip Herriage a former financial advisor and venture capitalist from Wall Street published a report examining suspicious trading involving MGM on a sister site linked to his website Virtual Research Advisory The startling passage below suggests that there wa an excessive amount of share sold off by MGM CEOChairman in the week leading up to the Las Vegas shootingWe at 21WIRE can not verify all of Herriage s claim but given his background and pedigree this post should be reviewed for further consideration a it appears to be another strange element revealed in the aftermath of the Las Vegas massacre We will examine the share price movement of two gun manufacturer American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger and the share price movement of MGM which owns Mandalay Bay We will also examine additional financial event surrounding MGM including what can only

emerged from the ether of the internet concerning the FBI and the Las Vegas shootingOver the past several year the FBI ha been routinely caught foiling their very own terror plot QUESTION Is it possible the FBI or any or intelligence agency played some part in the Las Vegas massacre whether inadvertently or otherwise ? In the search for answer regarding the investigative tactic of various intelligence agency that have come into question there s none perhaps more dubious than the Newburgh FBI sting that resulted in the entrapment four men who participated in a fabricated event created by the bureauHere s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how a FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot The Newburgh Four now languish in jail Hussain doe not For Hussain wa a fake In fact Hussain worked for the FBI a an informant trawling mosque in hope of picking up radicalsYet far from being active militant the four men he attracted were impoverished individual struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack drug crime and poverty One had mental issue so severe his apartment contained bottle of his own urine He also believed Florida wa a foreign countryHussain offered the men huge financial inducement to carry out the plot including $ 250000 to one man and free holiday and expensive carsAs defence lawyer poured through the evidence the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plot to lure target There ha been no case a egregious a this It is unique in the incentive the government provided A quarter million dollar ? said Professor Karen Greenberg a terrorism expert at Fordham University The reputation of the FBI ha suffered greatly in the recent past a well a over the past couple of decade Following the 1993 WTC bombing the FBI wa revealed to have been handling Emad A Salem a former Egyptian army officer who wa a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the bomb plotDomestically in America it ha been well documented that the FBI created a counter-intelligence program known a COINTELPRO not only a a way to influence but also a way to disrupt and coerce political faction from the inside out The FBI program infiltrated countless group and movement across the political spectrumAccording to report these group included but were not limited to the following The Black Panther Party The Communist Party of America the Ku Klux Klan the Socialist Workers Party the New Left the Students for a Democratic Society the American Indian Movement the Chicano Movement the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement Communist

conservative-majority Supreme Court where his appointee Neil Gorsuch could help settle the matter After the Richmond-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined on Thursday to lift a Maryland federal judge ’ s injunction halting the temporary ban ordered by Trump on March 6 Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the administration would appeal to the Supreme Court A second regional federal appeal court heard argument on May 15 in Seattle in the administration ’ s appeal of a decision by a federal judge in Hawaii also to block the ban A ruling by the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals is pending The Justice Department ha not made clear when the administration would make it formal appeal or whether it would wait for the 9th Circuit ruling before appealing If they take it up the justice would be called upon to decide whether court should always defer to the president over allowing certain people to enter the country especially when national security is the stated reason for an action a in this case They also would have to decide if Trump ’ s order violated the US Constitution ’ s bar against the government favoring one religion over another a the ban ’ s challenger assert Gorsuch ’ s April confirmation by the Republican-led Senate over Democratic opposition restored the court ’ s 5-4 majority which mean that if all the conservative justice side with the administration the ban would be restored regardless of how the four liberal justice vote During his Senate confirmation hearing Gorsuch wa questioned about Trump ’ s criticism of judge who ruled against the ban Gorsuch avoided commenting on the legal issue saying only that he would not be “ rubber stamp ” for any president While the justice could decide in the coming week whether to hear the case they likely would not hold oral argument until late in the year with a ruling sometime after that A final resolution may not come until perhaps a year after Trump issued the executive order The justice are not required to hear any case but this one meet important criterion cited by expert including that it would be the federal government filing the appeal and that it involves a nationwide injunction The administration could file an emergency application seeking to put the order into effect while the litigation on it legality continues At least five justice must agree for any such request to be granted While the court could split 5-4 along ideological line it also is possible some conservative justice could join the liberal in overturning the travel ban libertarian law professor Ilya Somin of George Mason University said “ Conservatives in other context often take a hard line against any kind of government discrimination based on race or religion or the like even if the motivation may be benign Also conservative have concern about government infringement on religion ” Somin said The 4th Circuit said the ban ’ s challenger including refugee group in the case argued by the American Civil Liberties Union were likely to succeed on their claim that the order violated the Constitution ’ s prohibition on the government favoring or disfavoring any religion In the 10-3 ruling three

appeal court ruling ’ s reliance on a concurring opinion in a 2015 Supreme Court immigration case by Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes side with the court ’ s liberal in big case In the 2015 case Kennedy wrote that in the immigration context the government ’ s action can be questioned if there is evidence of bad faith “ As with any opinion by Justice Kennedy I think the

1am on a Tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it But if we re buying into these institution like marriage I worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture Everyone is entitled to

Syria s central Homs province reported Friday that the missile killed at least 15 people including nine civilian Four of the dead were child Many more civilian were injured by two of the missile which struck nearby village Six of the dead were Syrian personnel at the al-Shairat airbaseThe missile strike wa the first time that Washington ha carried out a direct military attack against Syrian government force since the US and it regional ally orchestrated a war for regime change utilizing Al Qaeda-linked Islamist rebel a it proxy ground troop The attack on the airbase is a direct intervention in that war on the side of the Al Qaeda elementsRussian Prime Minister Medvedev warned on Friday that the immensely reckless action had brought Washington to the verge of a military clash with nuclear-armed Russia which had an air unit at the base struck by American missilesWashington seized on an alleged incident Tuesday involving chemical weapon in the village of Khan Sheikhoun in

function for existing regime or foreign power to conveniently concoct and steer event by pinning blame on patsiesSame strategy of controlled radical opposition in a game of obvious dialecticsLike Operation Gladio where from the 50 to the 80 left-wing radical were blamed for Euro-terror completely engineered and staged by a covert branch of NATO intelligence and P-2 affiliated masonry lodge similar pattern are seen in today s terror cell and lone wolf shooter Some wondered why I originally mentioned the masonic apparel in the original post but this is because Gladio used P-2 and secret society can function a network for organizing and arranging provocateur much like the Muslim Brotherhood or ISIS In short sniping event just like false flag are run by and advantageous to the state not lone wolf and terror cellsIndeed it is the same pattern mentioned above domestically with the FBI-hatched terror plot Terror in these instance function to exacerbate a strategy of tension to smear opposition promote undue fear and cajole the populace into accepting more surveillance and security theater Dallas saw a similarly implausible story last year of conspiracy theorist James Boulware a lone wolf shooter who purportedly shot at police after incoherent online ramblings which are quite clearly manufactured and now we are told Micah X ha a manifesto a must have for your daily shooter starter packHighly dubious James Boulware Dallas Shooting Fusion DrillsAs noted in my original video at least two large-scale multi-agency DHS supervised fusion drill in the Dallas-Ft Worth area preceded the 77 event by only a week One drill even included three shooter and bomb a narrative now fed into the mainstream medium concerning the Dallas sniping event Given every major terror event of recent recollection ha been preceded by a drill of the same scenario it should be obvious to question the Dallas event a it fit the same pattern a prior terror The familiar narrative of Dallas now includes IEDs hidden in mysterious locale a dubious claim inserted into the narrative of James Holmes booby-trapped apartment for example The date and locale for the event is also suspicious being in the vicinity of the JFK assassination a well a on the anniversary of the London 77 bombing another staged eventWe are supposed to believe Micah X learned his sniping and IED skill in the military and subsequently coordinated a professional hit man operation to target random white police over the shooting of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling that occurred that day ! Mass medium claimed the supposed shooter wa angry about event that transpired that day and subsequently had time to perform reconnaissance and establish sniper spot for that day s Black Lives Matter ProtestLunacy doe not end there a the standoff with police then involved the preposterous claim of utilizing and bomb-bot to blow the suspect up a he supposedly refused to cooperate Are bomb-bots now standard procedure ? Were the mainstream narrative of this event true and it certainly is not wouldn t law enforcement choose to gas the subject or subdue him to gather information about his so-called terror cell ? Instead the public wa fed a fantastical Robocop storyline to add tabloid juice to this manufactured event a we have seen in so manyPatsies dupe and provocateur Black power group are notorious for being infiltrated by federal agent and provocateur and the New Black Panther Party is a shining example Allowed to consistently call for the death of all white which is illegal this fake front group is allowed to continue to agitate and play on public fear like other terror group and racial identity movement Like the KKK or Elohim City and McVeigh the black power and Nation of Islam movement have been exposed a phony government front many time often identified by their outlandish and outrageous call for violenceMost famously this wa seen in the COINTELPRO operation with FBI informant Richard Aoki arming the Black Panthers to make them appear distastefully radicalPhoto-op Patty Hearst and the theatrical SLA abduction The Saul Alinsky-style approach of manufacturing radical for self-destructive social change that mark this event also ha precedent in two other previously contrived terror attack The Alinsky-inspired Bill Ayers Weather Underground event and Patty Hearst SLA staging Both event were manufactured operation that served to solidify mass opinion against anti-war movement while the SLA event in which reportedly 6 died while Patty Hearst wa not even in the building became the basis for America s adoption of SWAT team the Hearst soap opera kidnapping wa even followed by a television show called SWAT that aided in the rise of America s acceptance of the Warrior Cop This fact a well a the long-term federalization of local police refutes the faux right-wing narrative that Obama and company are anti-cop Seen in this light the Dallas event is ably summed up in it effectiveness for the establishment by Patrick Henningsen The Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levelsFirstly Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive a the Left or liberal wing of political society and the what is sold a America s Right or conservative wing In this dialectic Democrat is set against Republican young against old black is pitted against white wealthy against poor upper class against middle class and even middle class against lower class In the run-up to the Presidential election in November this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base or emotional level and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issue policy flaw and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 year which seems to be the norm Ultimately this serf the state it bureaucratic stakeholder and the power structure a a whole Secondly this event can be used to nudge the left-wing and Democrat party s own gun control agenda which is being aggressively pursued at the moment This wing of the political establishment ha already demonstrated that it ha no qualm about using a national incident or tragedy like the Orlando Shooting a warm PR leverage to push their emergency legislative agenda Ironically left-wing and black activist will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda much to the dismay of Conservative America As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateur anti-police or anti-government African-American militant or Black Power activist will be painted a poor light and effectively marginalized Once this process is complete the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any anti-government protest further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the USThirdly this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement Note the difference between the short and the long-term narrative at play here In the short-term this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed a a reaction to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the street of America but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to restore law and order thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity in an u against them dialectic by placing the nation s police a the protagonist and the public a the antagonist Pop culture promotion of supposed anti-establishment agitation and revolution In reality it is top-down social engineering and psychological warfareGiven the government admission that much of modern history ha been manipulated and contrived through false flag and staged event is it sensible to take the Dallas event at face value ? We are constantly reminded in every terror event to never forget 911 but a much more apt recollection would be to never forget the admission and example of fake and staged news a well a individual who supposedly die in three separate terror event being still alive show the lunacy of the fact there is no law or regulation upon the government and private infotainment news agency barring them from manufacturing event Rather the pattern 21Wire recognized and exposed in the recent Andrews Air Force Base s phony live shooter drill-gone-live scenario serf a the exemplary form of how these event are engineered especially given the drill preceding the 77 Dallas eventNaturally the alt right will seize upon the event a proof of a racial attack but this simply play into the establishment s desire for a helter skelter race war and a summer of chaos all of which wa prepared for symbolically through Beyonc s militant Black Panther Super Bowl Halftime Show back in February The race war is not fought with bat and mace in the street but through the toxic culture itself with it insidious programming for each racial groupAs we have seen in past event gun control is once again the unanimous cacophony while the labeling of Black Lives Matter a a terrorist group only serf to set further precedence for anyone critical of the establishment a an extremist or terrorist To hear Jay s full podcasts see more information and learn how you can become a subscriber to JaysAnalysisJay Dyer is the author of the forthcoming titleEsoteric Hollywood Sex Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Focusing on film philosophy geopolitics and all thing esotericJaysAnalysis and his podcast Esoteric Hollywood investigates the deeper meaning between the headline exploring the hidden aspect of our sinister synthetic mass medium matrixREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter FilesSupport our work by subscribing and becoming a member at 21WIRETV',\n 'MANILA Reuters - More than a thousand people attended a funeral procession on Saturday for a Philippine teenager slain by police last week turning the march into one of the biggest protest yet against President Rodrigo Duterte s deadly war on drug The death of Kian Loyd delos Santos ha drawn widespread attention to allegation that police have been systematically executing suspected user and dealer - a charge the authority deny Nuns priest and hundred of child chanting justice for Kian justice for all joined the funeral cortege a it made it way from a church to the cemetery where the 17-year-old wa buried Delos Santos father Saldy spoke briefly during a mass to defend his son s innocence and express anger over the police Don t they have a heart ?

Three week after I left my job at the clinic Planned Parenthood took me to court I am always asked Why would they take you to court ? Did they have something to hide ? Well yes They absolutely had something to hide They didn t want me sharing the information in this article Let s expose the truth shall we ? Yes I do realize that releasing this information put me in a precarious situation But it s always better for the truth to be out no matter the costIt wa life changing I remember the first time we were able to make an appointment with our new funding it wa called The Justice Fund After we had given the woman all of the necessary information about her abortion appointment we asked her if she wanted to apply for a funding program to help pay for her abortion She of course said yes We went through her income and expense and determined she wa eligible for funding We informed her that she would only have to pay $ 100 of the $ 400 cost The woman began to cry on the phone So I began to cry Wow We were going to change so many life with this money this Justice Fund When we were first told about The Justice Fund we were told that the money had been given by an anonymous donor Whoever this person wa wanted to be kept totally anonymous We a clinic director weren t even given the information The only people who knew were the board member of the National Abortion Federation NAF My bos happened to be on the board of NAF and we were pretty close Eventually over some drink at the annual NAF conference she spilled the beansFor month we had just known this person a the donor At the annual Planned Parenthood conference there wa a woman there representing the donor She never said her name to the crowd just said that she wa so honored to be among all of u all of u who were protecting woman s right She said that the donor wa so proud to work with u We knew that the donor wa giving NAF up to $ 21 million dollar every year to help poor woman pay for their abortionsHere s how the program worked While scheduling a woman for an abortion we would ask her if she would like financial assistance to help pay for her abortion Um of course they did We would then go through a screening tool given to u by NAF Pretty much everyone qualified and if they didn t we would rearrange the number so they did Then we would bill the amount owed to our clinic directly to NAF They would then send the bill to the donor and then the donor would send our check to NAF They would turn around and send the check to our clinicDuring the first year of the Justice Fund our abortion number grew by 100 % We literally doubled our abortion number Abortion wa much easier to sell when you didn t have the financial burden attached to itAbout six month into the program the rule changed I guess we were billing too much too fast Now the donor would only pay 40 % of the cost instead of 75 % That wa fine The woman were still so grateful to have a huge chunk of money taken off of their bill Now they were paying $ 240 for their $ 400 abortion I remember our frequent flyer being angry when we told them that the rule of the program had changed They wanted that 75 % discount ! Couldn t we make an exception for them since they had so many abortion at our clinic ? Sometimes we would Sometimes we would bill the donor for the entire amount I mean he didn t care They weren t actually looking to see if we were implementing the program correctly They just got the bill from u and sent the check They knew we were trustworthy Ha HaSo my answer to why Planned Parenthood took me to court ? Well I think it wa for two reasons1 They wanted to make an example out of me See worker if you defect from u you will find yourself in court too 2 Because I knew the in and out of the plan funded by the donor and I knew his name In 2003 there wa a big scandal that broke out surrounding the company Pampered Chef The majority of people selling this kitchenware were stay-at-home mom Many of them were pro-life woman So imagine their surprise when they found out that the new owner of their company Warren Buffett had given million to the abortion industry primarily Planned Parenthood Suddenly there wa a mass exodus from the company Women were done selling their overpriced spatula You can see more about that story hereSo when Warren Buffett decided that he wanted to start this Justice Fund in order to donate $ 21 million a year to the abortion industry you better believe that he wanted to remain anonymous He tried to disguise the donation under the foundation started by him in the name of his wife Susan Thompson Buffett But the 990s are for public consumption Anyone can see where they are spending their money Here s the most up to date financials for his foundation Click the year to view the 990 for that year201120122013I encourage you to take the time to look through these 990s so you can see the organization that he fund He gave a boatload of money to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG It s no wonder they have so diligently fought legislation like banning partial-birth abortion He gave 2 million dollar to the group called Catholics for Choice Of course they are not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church and in fact have essentially excommunicated themselves from the ChurchWarren Buffett is single-handedly influencing many university and medical institution with his money My advice is this Read through the list Find organization to write letter to Let them know that you will no longer be a supporter until they stop applying for grant to the Buffett Foundation Maybe invite your friend over and have a letter-writing get-together Send stack of letter to these organization Make your voice heard !

No I don t Sanders replied and then continued I think you know we have enormous problem facing this country and I think we got more thing to worry about than Bill Clinton s sexual life I think interestingly enough maybe Donald Trump might want to focus attention on climate change understand that climate change is not a hoax a he belief that it is that maybe Donald Trump should understand that we should raise the minimum wage in this country which he opposes and maybe we should not be giving huge tax break to fellow billionaire like Donald Trump So I think maybe he should focus on those thing Sanders concludedSanders made a similar critique of Trump last week Sanders claimed that he could win over Trump supporter That claim must have scared the hell out of Trump In le than 24 hour Trump responded to Bernie Sanders saying that he is in support of raising wage That s a complete flip from Trump s earlier claim that wage in the United States are too high Of course Trump called him a liar and acted like a complete douche bag about the whole thing Trump still insists that he doesn t think that the minimum wage should be raised but statement he made in Politico show that he is playing defense on the issueBernie Sanders got the Republican presidential primary runner to flip his script and adopt a more progressive message on a major issue So who know maybe sometime this week Trump will go all in on the importance of fighting climate change ?

according to an explosive report released in March by the Oregon Association of Scholars OAS and reported by The College FixComing from one of the nation s most liberal state the scholar can argue that they know first-hand what they are writing aboutTheir report focus on how university and college use diversity statement and their insistence that professor agree with them a the mean by which post-secondary institution weed out non left-wing scholar and hire liberalsThese diversity statement are integral to liberal ideology the OAS argues arguing that it is the doctrine of group victimization and their subsequent claim for group-based entitlement that mark diversity statement a partisan litmus test to ensure ideological purity of facultyThe association note that it is now routine for university to provide a diversity statement template that is like a checklist for progressive cause These template insist that professor will wholeheartedly agree to keep the white student from dominating all classroom discussion and reflect a commitment to queer visibility while advising student against the temptation to thoughtlessly reproduce the standard white and Western model of legitimate knowledge More than 20 college enforce a requirement that faculty demonstrate their commitment to the ideal of diversity equity and inclusion the OAS found However they say this is only the tip of the political correctness iceberg a many post-secondary institution do not directly enforce the diversity requirement but administer it through coercion and that many institution demand adherence to diversity statement for entrance to PhD program or when applying for a university jobThe University of Oregon used a diversity statement scheme like this when it ordered that a faculty member s teaching must reflect the diversity of the field including the racial ethnic and gender diversity of it scholar and practitioner The university also demand that professor exercise good faith

I reject with outrage the way this man take it upon himself to treat the head of our country s government That is unacceptable It is but it s hard to expect Trump to understand that at this point In

Presidential debate Donald Trump proposed getting rid of the Environmental Protection Agency altogether a government agency founded in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon Trump s skewed logic wa the agency s $ 8 billion budget is wasted and should be reallocated to the statesIn response to Rubio s pressing of Trump for what his plan is to cut tax and balance the federal budget Trump replied Environmental protection we waste all of this money We re going to bring that back to the state We are going to cut many of the agency we will balance our budget and we will be dynamic again The radical proposal of Trump defies anything remotely close to being realistic Trump ha also accused the EPA of creating more damage than they protect and making it impossible for the country to compete His rhetoric is part of the mode of thinking many of his supporter have that the government somehow is impeding their ability to improve their life and the solution is de-regulating everything in order for a free market of competition will solve everything In reality dissolving the EPA which would involve repealing many environmental law would leave environmental protection up to the state where most do not have the resource to enforce meaningful environmental regulation This would also cause a vacuum of competition where state would try to appeal to hazardous industry to come to their state by downgrading environmental regulationsBecause the entire Republican Party ha lost their mind Trump s proposal is one that ha also been adopted by Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Ted Cruz This past January Rubio dubbed the EPA the Employment Prevention Agency adding the agency s regulation are out of control and hurt our economyCruz who already is notorious for wanting to repeal all federal

oversight are needed to mitigate the effect of climate change and other environmental influencesDissolving the EPA is just one of the many danger the Republican presidential candidate pose to the American public if elected and if they were ever successful in doing so the damage incurred could potentially destroy part of the country indefinitely with hazardous site toxic waste pollution and increasing emission rate becoming more of the norm If anything the EPA s funding need to be increased and the agency improved by making it more effective because the stake couldn t be higher America

open to reforming the country ’ s biofuels policy if it can be done in a way that protects job in both the refining and agriculture industry senator said on Thursday after a meeting with Trump on the issue Nine lawmaker had requested the meeting to argue that the Renewable Fuel Standard or RFS a law requiring refiner to blend increasing amount of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the fuel supply every year wa threatening to put refinery in their district out of business The Trump administration had ruled in favor of Big Corn and against the refining industry in a series of decision this year with senator on both side using parliamentary procedure like hold on administrative appointment to punish rival Senator Ted Cruz of Texas who led the lawmaker delegation said Trump wa open to a “ win-win ” solution “ The group a a whole agreed with the president to reconvene next week and to expand the group and work together to find a solution that is a win for blue-collar worker a win for job but also a win for farmer at the same time ” he told Fox News after the meeting Republican Senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and James Lankford of Oklahoma also said Trump expressed a desire to help refiner in a way that protected the interest of farmer but that more discussion were needed “ It wa just a recognition that this is a more complicated problem and we ’ re going to have to get everybody together from all side ” Lankford told reporter The White House said the meeting wa productive and that Trump remained committed to the RFS farmer and energy worker “ He understands there are differing view on this issue and the Administration look forward to working with all the stakeholder toward a mutually agreeable path forward ” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement The RFS wa introduced more than a decade ago by President George W Bush a a way to boost US agriculture slash energy import and cut emission and ha since fostered a market for ethanol amounting to 15 billion gallon a year Refiners oppose the RFS because they say it cost them hundred of million of dollar a year in blending and regulatory expense while propping up demand for rival fuel Refiners that do not have the facility to blend biofuels must purchase credit called RINs from those that do and hand them into the EPA once a year A refining lobbyist briefed on Thursday ’ s meeting said one possible solution discussed wa capping the RINs - an idea that is opposed by the Renewable Fuels Association the largest biofuel trade group The refining industry ha requested tweak to the policy in the past that would cut the annual volume target for biofuels allow ethanol export to be counted against those target or shift the blending burden to supply terminal While the leadership of the EPA which administers the RFS had considered some of the change it ultimately rejected them under pressure from Midwestern lawmaker and slightly increased biofuels volume target for 2018 The meeting with Trump could set the stage for negotiation over legislation but any measure would likely require cooperation from representative of the corn belt Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said this week he wa not invited to the meeting and called it “ a waste of time ” Biofuels industry representative did not attend the meeting Cruz ha said he would block Iowa Agriculture

that might backfire on you The salesman who asked to remain anonymous also spoke of Sweden s many Facebook group in which people in different village openly discus how they intend to protect themselves Sometimes you get totally freaked out when you see what they are writing But you have to understand that Swedes are really scared when an asylum house open in their village They can see what ha happened in other place One blog detailing the consequence for the local population when an asylum facility open is aptly named Asylkaos Asylum Chaos There is a list of company the reader is prompted to boycott the blog claim these business encourage the transformation of Sweden to a multicultural society and are therefore considered hostile to Swedes At another security company a salesman said that every time the Immigration Service buy or rent a new housing facility his firm is swamped with call The next day he said half the village call and want to buy alarm system Ronny Fredriksson spokesman of the security company Securitas said that the demand for home alarm system first exploded about six year ago when many local police station were shut down and police moved to the main town This he said could result in response time of several hour More and more people now employ the service of our security guard Shopping mall and store in the city come together and hire guard We are kind of like the local beat cop of old Even though Securitas make big money from the increased need for home security alarm and security guard Fredriksson say they also are worried about the effect on society The problem is that we too need the police When our guard catch a burglar or a violent person we call the police but the response time are often very long Sometimes the detainee get violent and quite rowdy On occasion the police have told u to release the person we have apprehended if we have his identity because they do not have a patrol nearby Even before the massive influx of migrant in the fall of 2015 Swedes felt a need to protect themselves and with good reason Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish crime ha exploded Violent crime ha increased by more than 300 % and rape have increased by an unbelievable 1472 % The politician however ignore the people s fear completely It is never discussed Instead the people who express concern about what kind of country Sweden ha become are accused of xenophobia and racism Most likely that is the reason more and more people are taking matter into their own hand and protecting themselves and their family to the best of their abilityAll the same some people do not settle for that It seems some people are trying to stop mass immigration to Sweden Almost every day there are report of fire being set at asylum house So far miraculously no one ha been hurtThese fire are set not only by Swedes On October 13 a 36-year-old woman living in Skellefte wa convicted of setting fire to the asylum facility in which she herself resided The woman claimed she lit a candle and then fell asleep Yet forensic evidence showed that a combustible fluid had been doused throughout the room and the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that she herself had ignited the fireThe number of violent incident at Sweden s Immigration Service facility is now sky-high In 2013 according to Dispatch International at least one incident happened every day When Gatestone Institute recently acquired the incident list for January 1 2014 through October 29 2015 that number had risen to 2177 incident of threat violence and brawl on average three per dayThe Swedish government however would apparently rather not talk about that Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr m conceded in an interview with the daily Dagens Nyheter that garnered international attention that Sweden is in fact heading for a systemic breakdown Most people seem to think we can not maintain a system where perhaps 190000 people will arrive every year In the long run our system will collapse This welcome is not going to receive popular support We want to give people who come here a worthy reception Symptomatic of Swedish journalist this statement wa tucked away at the end of the article The headline wa about how the political party that is critical of immigration the Sweden Democrats Party Sverigedemokraterna is responsible for the asylum-housing fire But foreign medium such a The Daily Mail and Russia Today picked up Wallstr m s warning about a systemic collapse and ran it a the urgent news it actually isNevertheless in official Sweden the imminent collapse is ignored Instead journalist exclusively focus on attack by supposedly racist Swedes on refugee center To prevent new fire the Immigration Service decided on October 28 that from now on all asylum facility would have secret address And meager police resource will now be stretched even further to protect asylum seeker Police helicopter will even patrol refugee center But considering there are only five helicopter available and that Sweden s landmass is 407340 square km 157274 square mile this gesture is effectively emptyAt a meeting with the Nordic Council in Reykjavik Iceland on October 27 Sweden s Prime Minister Stefan L fven wa questioned by his Nordic colleague about the situation in Sweden L fven had recently said that We should have the option of relocating people applying for asylum in Sweden to other EU-countries Our ability too ha a limit We are facing a paradigm shift That comment led a representative of Finland s Finns Party Sannfinl ndarna to wonder with a hint of irony how mass immigration to Sweden which for year Swedish politician have touted a being so profitable ha now suddenly become a burdenAnother Finns Party representative Simon Elo pointed out that the situation in Sweden is out of control Sweden ha great ability but not even the Swedes have ability that great Elo saidWhen L fven wa asked how he is dealing with the real concern and demand of the citizenry his answer wa laconic Of course I understand there is concern L fven said It is not easy But at the same time there are 60 million people on the run This is also about them being our fellow men and I hope that viewpoint will prevail The daily tabloid Expressen asked L fven about the attack on asylum facility He replied Our community should not be characterized by threat and violence they should be warm and show solidarity As if such behavior can be forcedMany Swedes see mass immigration a a forced marriage Sweden is forced to marry a man she did not choose yet she is expected to love and honor him even though he beat her and treat her badly And on top of that her parent the government tell her to be warm and show solidarity with himMore and more Swedish commentator are now drawing the same conclusion that Sweden is teetering on the brink of collapse Editorial columnist Ivar Arpi of the daily Svenska Dagbladet wrote an astonishing article on October 26 about a woman named Alexandra von Schwerin and her husband The couple life on the Skarhults Estate farm in Sk ne in southern Sweden they have been robbed three time Most recently they were robbed of a quad bike a van and a car When the police arrived von Schwerin asked them what she should do The police told her that they could not help her All our resource are on loan to the asylum reception center in Trelleborg and Malm they said We are overloaded right now So I suggest you get in touch with the vigilante group in Esl v What the police had called a vigilante group turned out to be a group of private business owner In 2013 after being robbed more or le every night they had decided to come together and start patrolling the area themselves Currently they pay a security firm to watch their facility On principal I am totally against it von Schwerin said What are the people who can not afford private security to do ? They will be unprotected I m sure I will join but very very reluctantly For the first time I feel scared to live here now Are the State and I now in agreement that our mutual contract is being renegotiated ? Commenting on the police s encouraging people to join vigilante group social commentator and former Refugee Ombudsman Merit Wager wrote So the Swedes are supposed to arrange and pay for their own and their family security and keep their farm from being subjected to theft even though that ha up to now been included in the social contract for which we pay high tax to have police we can count on to protect u and apprehend criminal ? ! When did the social contract expire ? October 2015 ? Without any notice of termination since the tax-consuming party is not fulfilling it part of the deal ? This should mean that our part of the deal to pay tax for public joint service ha also become invalid ? If the social contract is broken it is broken Then it is musical chair lawlessness defenselessness without protection and that mean that each and every one of u should pay le tax Ilan Sad lawyer and social commentator wrote about the refugee chaos at Malm Central Train Station on the blog Det Goda Samh llet on October 27 The authority no longer honor the social contract He described four large sign on display around the station that read Refugee ? Welcome to Malm ! in four different language It is unclear who the sender of the message is or for that matter who is in charge of the reception facility a number of barrack by the old post office in the inner harbor Everything is utterly confusing It could be Malm City or the Immigration Service but it might a well be Refugees Welcome or possibly a religious community I think to myself that a government agency could not reasonably write like this a correct and pertinent sign would say something like Asylum seeker are referred to the barrack for information and further transport But I am probably wrong Malm City is the chief suspect communicant The sign in and around the Central Station are symptom of something incredibly serious Role confusion and the decay of the constitutional state And thus that our authority no longer honor the social contract In a post called Anarchy blogger Johan Westerholm who is a Social Democratic Party member and a critic of the government wrote that the Minister for Justice and Migration Morgan Johansson is now urging authority to be pragmatic about law and regulation concerning asylum housing for so-called unaccompanied refugee child Westerholm stated that this is tantamount to the government opening the gate to anarchy Our country is founded on law Parliament legislates and the court apply these Morgan Johansson s statement and his otherwise passive approach are testimony to how this our kind of democracy may fade into a memory very shortly He now laid the first brick in the building of a state that rest on other principle

will end up taking 39 trip to Mar-a-Lago in 2017 at a whopping cost of $ 130 million to taxpayer which mean Trump will outspend President Obama within a single year Furthermore Trump would easily surpass Obama s number of vacation day At the current pace he would end up taking 320 vacation day in four year and that s not counting other vacation Trump may end up taking If he start going to Florida every weekend he would surpass 400 day And if he play golf every time he go to Mar-a-Lago he will have played more round of golf in two year than than President Obama did during his first termIf Trump doe this every year the cost to taxpayer will be a monstrous $ 520 million after four year That s right over half a billion dollarsTrump supporter and conservative will argue that Trump is working during his vacation but President Obama worked during his vacation too yet conservative never stopped whining about his vacationsAnd just because Trump might be working a little during his

blacklisted or trending I believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news I d come on shift and I d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topic wouldn t be trending because either the curator didn t recognize the news topic or it wa like they had a bias against Ted Cruz The source kept an active log of the omission which included former IRS official Lois

the National Security Agency the CIA and the Treasury Department s financial crime unit The investigator have accelerated their effort in recent week but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing the official said One official said intelligence report based on some of the wiretapped communication had been provided to the White HouseCounterintelligence investigation examine the connection between American citizen and foreign government Those connection can involve effort to steal state or corporate secret curry favor with American government leader or influence policy It is unclear which Russian official are under investigation or what particular conversation caught the attention of American eavesdropper The legal standard for opening these investigation is low and prosecution are rareIn short it s unlikely that anyone will be charged but we a Americans have every reason to be concerned with the people with whom Trump surround himself Manafort naturally call the allegation a Democrat Party dirty trick and completely false I have never had any relationship with the Russian government or any Russian official I wa never in contact with anyone or directed anyone to be in contact with anyone he add On the Russian hacking of the DNC my only knowledge of it is what I have read in the paper Politifact confirmed last year that Manafort ha many relationship with pro-Putin politician in Ukraine at minimumWhile Trump will attempt to connect this to the 35-page pee pee dossier published by Buzzfeed the one handed to Trump and Obama by intelligence agency the FBI say that the decision to open the investigation wa not based on those in the leastThe FBI investigation into Mr Manafort began last spring and wa an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine and for the country s former president Viktor F Yanukovych In August The Times reported that Mr Manafort s name had surfaced in a secret ledger that showed

Stone said he had never visited Russia and had no Russian client He said that he had worked in Ukraine for a pro-Western party but that any assertion that he had tie to Russian intelligence wa nonsense and totally false The whole thing is a canard he said I have no Russian influence The Senate intelligence committee ha started it own investigation into Russia s purported attempt to disrupt the election The committee s inquiry is broad and will include an examination of Russian hacking and possible tie between people associated with Mr Trump s campaign and RussiaInvestigators are also scrutinizing people on the periphery of Mr Trump s campaign such a Mr Page a former Merrill Lynch banker who founded Global Energy Capital an investment firm in New York that ha done business with RussiaIn an interview on Thursday Mr Page expressed bewilderment about why he might be under investigation He blamed a smear campaign that he said wa orchestrated by Mrs Clinton for medium speculation about the nature of his tie to Russia I did nothing wrong for the 5000th time he said His adversary he added are pulling a page out of the Watergate playbook What further detail will the investigation
